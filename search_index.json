\n작성: 김지훈 (jihuun.k@gmail.com)  \n\n들어가면서\n인공지능 담론은 분야를 막론하고 화제이다. 심지어 미술분야에서도 언급된다. 최근에 서울 국립현대 미술관에 불온한 데이터라는 전시가 있었다. 그 중 한 작품은 머신러닝으로 학습한 알고리즘이 그렸다. 과거 인간의 회화 형태를 학습해서 기존에 없었던 새로운 스타일의 회화를 그린 작품이었다. 또 한 사회적으로는 인공지능이 인류의 일자리를 빼앗을 것이다라는 담론등 미디어에는 온갖 공포가 가득하기도 하다. 우리의 모든 삶에 이미 깊숙히 침투해버린 인공지능 이슈를 어떻게 판단해야할까? 잘 모르는 대상은 왜곡되기 마련이다. 그렇기 때문에 더욱 머신러닝이 어떤학문인지 직접 확인해보고 싶었다. 그래야 무분별한 공포로부터 해방될 수 있다. 인공지능은 정말 인류의 모든 일자리를 빼앗고 SF영화처럼 인간을 제거하게 될까? 지금 까지 내가 내린 결론은 전혀 그렇지않다. 사람들은 과거의 기술은 과소평가하면서 현재의 기술은 과대평가하는 경향이 있다. 머신러닝은 분명 유용한 기술이긴 하지만 인류를 위협할 수 있는 종류의 기술이라는 생각은 들지 않는다. 한스로슬링의 저서 \"펙트풀니스\"에 따르면 인간 집단에겐 부정본능이 있어서 어떤 잘 모르는 대상이나 담론을 더욱 부정적으로 보는 시각이 있다고 한다. 또한 생물학적 생존을 위해 진화한 공포본능은 실제 위협과 과장된 위협을 잘 구분하지 못하게 한다. 내가 이 강좌를 통해 머신러닝을 공부하게 된 계기는 사실 머신러닝을 기술 개발 업무에 이용하기 위함은 아니었다. 인공지능 담론을 대처하는 나만의 시각을 갖기 위해서 였다. 적어도 머신러닝이 뭔지라도 알고 살아야겠다는 생각에 공부를 시작했다. 나는 머신러닝을 단순히 교양수준의 지식, 순수하게 지적 호기심을 충족시켜줄 대상으로 접근했다. 기술의 관점보다는 인문학의 관점으로 이해하려고 노력했다.\n머신 러닝은 인공-지능이 아니다.\n\n프로그래밍으로써 머신러닝\n\n머신러닝이 인공지능이라고 불리는게 머신러닝의 본질을 흐리게 한다고 생각한다. 머신러닝은 공상과학이 말하는 인공지능과는 다소 차이가 있다. 머신러닝은 인공적 \"지능\"이라기 보다는 수학,통계이다. 그리고 컴퓨터 공학적 관점에서는 데이터를 기반으로 하는 프로그래밍이라고도 볼 수 있다. 머신러닝은 기존 data를 잘 표현하는 함수를 찾고 새로운 문제를 예측하는데 쓰는 방법론이다. 이것은 일반적인 프로그램의 구조인 분기문(if/else)과 반복을(for) 사용하여 프로그램을 작성하던 rulebase pragramming 과는 또 다른 형태의 프로그래밍 기법이며 프로그래밍의 또다른 패러다임이다.(사실 새로운 패러다임이라고 하기에는 머신러닝은 꽤나 오래된 학문이기도 하다.) 어떤 문제를 해결할때 기존처럼 코딩해서도 해결할 수 있지만 머신러닝을 이용해서도 해결할 수도 있는 것이다. 지금까지 밝혀진 이 세계는 두가지 종류의 문제를 가지고 있다. 코딩으로 짠 알고리즘이 더 잘 해결하는 문제와 data를 기반으로 학습된 알고리즘이 더 잘해결하는 문제.\n머신러닝을 데이터 과학자나 엔지니어만 사용한다면 과학기술 문명의 발전속도는 그리 빠르지 못할것이다. 모든 사람들이 필요하다면 각 분야에서 사용할 수 있어야 한다. 하지만 일반 사람들이 익히기에는 다소어려워 보일수는 있다. 다양한 수식과 소스코드를 볼수 있기 때문이다. 그렇지만 머신러닝이 수학적,공학적 전문지식이 있는 사람들만 다룰 수 있는 도구는 아니다. 양자역학 같이 이해하기 어려운 학문도 아니다. 학습자 개개인의 배경에따라 기호와 개념에 익숙해지는 시간의 차이만 있을뿐, 누구나 배우고 익힐 수 있는 학문이라고 생각한다. 머신러닝의 본질은 \"문제 해결의 또다른 방식\" 이라는데에 있다. 이미 프로그래밍은 다양한 인문/자연/사회 과학 또는 더 넓은 분야에서 문제해결 도구로 활발히 사용되고 있고 앞으로 더욱 그래야만 한다. 생물학, 천문학, 인류학, 사회과학, 심리학, 철학, 사학, 미학 등등. 각 분야마다 해결하고자 하는 고유의 문제들이 있는데 지금까지 기존의 코딩으로 이것을 해결했다면 앞으로는 머신러닝으로도 접근해볼수 있는 것이다. 머신러닝이 기존의 프로그래밍 기법을 대체하는것이 아니다. 각자 해결하기 좋은 고유의 영역이 있는것이다.\nandrew ng 교수가 한국에서 인터뷰했던 기사1에서 그는 이렇게 말했다. 한 조직(회사)에 추가로 AI팀하나를 만들지말고 이미 존재하는 각 팀에서 AI를 활용하라고. 이 말이 위에서 말한내용과 같은 맥락인 것이다. 나는 linux kernel 개발자다. 그렇다면 당연히 머신러닝을 리눅스 커널에 적용 할수도 있지 않을까? 리눅스 커널같은 운영체제 내에서도 머신러닝을 활용해 성능향상이나 문제를 해결할수 있는 것들이 많이 있을것이다. 커널에서 발견되는 무수히 많은 문제들을 프로그램을 짜서 해결할 수 도 있고 머신러닝을 이용해서 해결할 수도 있는 것이다.2\n머신러닝에 있어서 AI라는 용어가 더 부각이 되면, AI가 인류의 지능을 뛰어넘어 인류의 일자리를 다 빼앗고 인류를 착취한다는 식의 공상과학만 쓸 수 밖에 없다. 현대 인류는 이미 AI라는 용어에 선입견을 가지고 있기 때문이다. 나도 처음에 그랬지만 머신러닝을 조금 공부해보니 내가 영화에서 보던 AI와는 너무 달라서 놀랐다. 머신러닝이 공상과학의 스스로 생각하는 초지능이 되는것은 불가능한것 같다. 기계 학습 machine learning의 의미가 기계가 스스로 학습해서 인간보다 더 똑똑해진다는 뜻이 절대 아니다. 심지어 머신러닝 학습 알고리즘은 인간들이 만들어낸 data기반으로 학습하는 것이기 때문에 그것을 초월하는 것이 물리적으로 가능하지도 않다. 머신러닝은 그저 문제 해결에 사용할 수 있는 프로그래밍의 새로운 패러다임일 뿐이다. 그리고 전문가만 사용하는게 아니라 일반인들이 각 분야에 적용해야 그 가치를 발휘할 수 있다고 생각한다.\n\n1 https://www.mk.co.kr/news/business/view/2018/07/456717/2 아직 활발하지는 않지만 점점 시도되고 있는듯 하다.

ML tool은 Weka 를 사용했다.\n헬로 데이터 과학\n\n데이터 과학으로써 머신러닝\n\n작년에 키르기스탄을 여행할 때였다. 여행하며 일하는 일명 디지털노마드인 미국인 케빈을 만났다. 그는 스타트업을 운영하고 있었고 그들의 제품은 놀랍게도 \"비포장 도로의 데이터\" 였다. 그 데이터를 적절한 기관이나 회사에 판매하는 것이다. 흥미롭게도 당시에 이케아가 그들의 제품에 관심이 있었는데, 이유는 안전한 운송을 위한 도로 데이터가 필요했기 때문이다. 그래서 그는 비포장도로가 많은 나라들 방문하여 데이터를 수집하고 여행하고 있었던 것이다! 그 뒤 케냐의 나이로비에서 케빈의 동료 그렉을 만났다. 그렉은 데이터 사이언티스트이다. 당시 \"제품으로서의 데이터\"는 내게 생소했으므로 이들에게 매우 깊은 감명을 받았다. 그리고 깨달았다. 이제는 물리적 제품이나 서비스가 중요한것이 아니라, 거기서 얻을 수 있는 데이터가 정말 중요한 것이라는것을! 그것은 지금 까지 내가 제품을 대했던, 그리고 제품을 통해 얻으려고 했던 고정관념이 산산조각나는 경험이었다.\n지식의 스펙트럼을 무차별적으로 늘려가고 있는 요즘, 또 한가지 깨달은 것이있다. 제품 뿐만아니라 모든 학문도 데이터 과학이라는 것이다. 다시말해 데이터가 새로운 과학이다. 적어도 인문과학, 사회과학, 자연과학 분야에 존재하는 학문들, 이를테면 인류학, 진화론, 도시공학, 인구학, 역사학, 지리학,.... 예외가 떠오르지 않을 정도로 모든분야에는 아직도 수많은 데이터가 가공되지 않은채 허공에 부유하고 있다. 결국 그것들로 부터 어떻게 데이터를 추출하고 가공하고 유의미한 결과를 도출할 수 있는지가 관건이다. 다시말하면 그 수많은 데이터들 속에 아직 발견되지 않은 보석같은 '지식'들이 인류를 기다리고 있는것이다. 그것이 새로운 시대에 인류가 지식을 만들어가는 방법이다.\n이런 거창한것을 떠나서도, 우리 개인 또한 데이터를 얼마나 많이 생성하고 있는가? 이것들을 유용한 도구로 활용할 수 있는 능력은 이 새로운 시대에서 생존하는데 대단히 유리한 기술임이 분명하다. 일반 사람들이 생활속에서 데이터를 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지 알려주는 책인 \"헬로우 데이터 과학\"에서는 '데이터를 삶과 업무에 활용하고자 하는 개인'이 알아야할 데이터 과학은 '데이터 과학자'로서 알아야할 데이터 과학과는 엄연히 다르다고 말한다. 머신러닝은 그런 개인이 어떻게 데이터를 가공하고 유용한 정보를 추출하고 도구화하여 적절한 상황에 활용할 수 있을지 알려준다. 충분한 데이터를 소유하고 있고 그것을 머신러닝같은 도구를 통해 유용한 정보를 추출할 수 있다면 분명 급격하게 변화하는 동시대를 살아갈때에 훌륭한 길라잡이가 될수 있지 않을까?\n"},"documents/1-introduction.html":{"url":"documents/1-introduction.html","title":"1.

Introduction\n\n1.1.1. ML의 두가지 정의\n\n컴퓨터에게 특정한 프로그래밍 없이도 스스로 학습할 수 있게 만들어주는 연구\"Machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.\"     \n\n작업 T가있고, P로 성능이 측정될때, 그 P가 경험E를 통해 학습하며 향상되는 프로그램.om Mitchell provides a more modern definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"    \n  Example: playing checkers.    \n  E = the experience of playing many games of checkers  T = the task of playing checkers.  P = the probability that the program will win the next game.    \n\n\n1.1.2. ML 알고리즘 종류\n\nSupervided learning (지도 학습)\n이미 정답을 알고있는 데이터에 기반해 예측모델을 만드는 ML  \nUnsupervided learning (비지도 학습)\n정답을 모르는 데이터에서 유용한 정보를 분류, 추출 하는 ML  \nOthers  Reinforcement Learning  Recommender systems    \n\n이 강좌는 Supervided learning, Unsupervided learning 두가지에대해 중점적으로 배운다.     \n1.1.3. 응용분야\n\n빅 데이터 분석    \n사람이 일일이 프로그래밍할수 없는 분야무인vehicle, 자연어처리, 손글시인식, 영상처리    \nSelf-customizing programs    \nunderstanding human learning    \n\n1.1.4. Supervised Learning (지도 학습)\ndata set이 이미 있고 우리는 그 데이터에 대한 답을 이미 알고있을때, 그런 상태에서 컴퓨터를 학습시키는 방법. 우리가 알고리즘에게 정확한 답을 알고있는 data set을 준다. data set의 형태는 [data, label] 이다. 즉 [데이터, 그에 상응하는 답] 이다. 따라서 예측하는 대상은 label이 아직 정해지지 않은 data set인 것이다. 사례: 손글씨 숫자(http://solarisailab.com/archives/1785). 이때 예측하는 결과값이 연속인지/이산적인지에 따라 다음 처럼 두가지로 분류된다.      \n\nRegression problem: 연속적인 결과값을 예측  다음 3달동안 얼마나 많은 제품이 팔릴지 예측하는것  부동산 팔 집값 예측    \nClassification problem: 이산적인 결과값을 예측  각 계정이 해킹을 당했는지/아닌지 판단하기  종양 크기에 따라서 양성/음성 예측.    \n\nClassification 문제는 이산적인 결과값을 예측하는 문제 이다. 예를들어 종양 크기에 따라서 양성/음성 예측한다고 하자. 먼저 단순히 종양의 크기에 따라 분류할 수 있다. 두번째로 아래 그래프 처럼 크기에 나이라는 속성(feature)도 같이 고려하여 분류할 수 있다. 그것 뿐만아니라 더많은 속성을 고려할 수 있다. Clump 두께, 종양 세포크기의 균일함, 모양의 균일함 등등.. Learning 알고리즘은 이런 속성이 두 세개를 넘어서 무한이 많아질 수 있다. (그렇게 되면 그래프의 축이 무한히 많아지는것이다. 그 무한히 많은 축(차원)에서 아래 linear한 직선같이 구분지을 수 있는 함수를 찾는것이 예측 모델을 찾는것이라고 볼 수 있다.)\n    \n1.1.5. Unsupervised Learning (비지도 학습)\n반면 비지도학습은 데이터에 대한 label(정답)이 주어지지 않은 상태에서 컴퓨터를 학습시키는 방법이다.  즉 [data] 의 형태로 학습을 진행한다. 따라서 주로 데이터에 숨겨진 특징이나 구조를 발견하는데 사용된다.     \n\nClustering 알고리즘: 주어진 data들을 clustering함    \nNon-Clustering 알고리즘: 칵테일 파티장 녹음데이터에서 특정음성만 분리해냄.    \n\n예를 들어 다음과 같은 문제를 해결할때 사용가능하다. 수많은 뉴스를 자동으로 clustering해서 분류하는 알고리즘, 특정 유전자로 개체별 특성 분류, 천문학, 소셜 네트워크  \n    \n\n각 o가 어떤걸 의미하는지는 모르나, 두개의 그룹으로 분류되는것처럼 보임    \n\n    \n\n비슷한 종류의 유전자끼리 분류가 됨    \n\n1.1.6. 참고: Reinforcement Learning\n강화학습은 에이전트가 주어진 환경(state)에 대해 어떤 행동(action)을 취하고 이로부터 어떤 보상(reward)을 얻으면서 학습을 진행한다. 이때, 에이전트는 보상(reward)을 최대화(maximize)하도록 학습이 진행된다    \n"},"documents/1.2-linear-regression-with-one-variable.html":{"url":"documents/1.2-linear-regression-with-one-variable.html","title":"1.2.

Linear Regression with One Variable\n\n1.2.1. Model and Cost Function\n\n이번장에서는 Linear regression 알고리즘에 대해 알아보고 Model에 대해서 그리고 지도학습의 전체 과정에 대해서 알아볼 것이다.\nLinear regression은 입력된 값을 기반으로 결과값을 예측하는 알고리즘이다. 이장에서는 집값을 예측하는데 Linear regression을 사용해볼 것이다. 그것을 위해서 cost function 과 gradient descent 라는 개념에대해서 살펴볼 것이다.  \n1.2.2 Linear Regression\n    \n위와 같은 데이터가 있을때, 1250 사이즈의 집이 있다고 치면, 얼마의 값으로 팔면 좋을지 예측하는 문제가 있다고 하자. 가장 먼저 해볼 수 있는것은 Model을 만드는 것이다. 가장 간단한 모델은 그림의 분홍색 그래프처럼 linear 한 선을 그어보는 것이다. 이것이 Supervised learning의 한 예시이다. 그이유는 이 문제에서 나의 문제(팔 가격 예측)에 적합한 답을 주기 때문이다.     \n이것은 traning set이라고 하는 data set이다. 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 이 데이터로부터 어떻게 주택 가격을 예측할지 학습시키는 것이다.     \n이 강의에서는 다음의 notation을 사용하기로 약속한다.      \nm: 학습 데이터 갯수x: input값, featurey: output, target    \n\n가령 위의 표에서 x_1 = 2104,  x_2 = 1416, y_1 = 460 이다.    \n\n1.2.3. Model Representation\n중요한 Hypothesis Function (가설 함수) 개념에대해 알아보자. 결국 머신러닝의 최종목적은 예측을 위해 이 가설함수를 생성하는것이다. 데이터를 통해 학습을 진행하는것은 함수의 parameter를학습하는 것과 같다.  만약 데이터가 직선(linear)이라면 Hypothesis Function은 다음과 같이 1차 방정식으로 나타낼 수 있다.   h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x  . 여기서 학습을 한다는것은 기존의 데이터를 잘 표현하는 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 찾는것이다. 도식화 하면 아래와 같다.   \n    \n\ntraining set 데이터를 학습 알고리즘을 거치면 함수가 나오는데 그것을 h라고 표기한다. Hypothesis Function 이라고 부른다.    \n\n1.2.4. Cost Function (비용함수)\nCost Function은 Hypothesis Function의 정확도를 평가하기 위함 도구다. h(x) 함수가   h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x   라고 할때, \\theta_0 \\theta_1 을 어떻게 선택하느냐에 따라 h(x)는 아래의 그래프를 갖게 된다. 비용함수는 주어진 데이터(training set)를 가지고 X에 상응하는 Y를 정확히 예측하는 함수 h를 찾을때 필요하다. \n    \n그래프에서 볼수 있듯이 어떤 \\theta_0 \\theta_1 값을 선택하느냐에 따라서 직선의 기울기가 달라진다. \\theta_0 \\theta_1을 적절하게 선택하여 만든 h(x)의 값과, 실제 결과값 y와 얼마나 차이가 있는지 확인하는것이 cost function이다. 이 차이가 적을 수록 우리는 정확한 가설함수h(x)를 찾은것이다. 그렇게 하기 위해서 (예측값 - 실제값)의 차이가 최소화가 되도록하는 \\theta_0 \\theta_1 찾으면 되는것이다.  그것을 공식화하면 아래와 같다. 이것이 Cost Function이다. J(\\theta_0 \\theta_1)로 표현되는 이 Cost Function은 오차함수의 제곱이라도고 불린다. 이 제곱함수는 회귀분석(regression)에서 가장 많이 사용된다. (제곱을 하는 이유는 음수, 또는 미분을 해야하기 때문)     \n자세히 살펴보면 공식자체는 별게 없다. training set에서 각 (예측값i - 실제값i)을 제곱하고 합을구한뒤 전체 training set 갯수 m으로 나눠서 평균을 낸것일 뿐이다.  \n    \n위와같이 빨간색 X 위치에 데이터가 존재할때 그것을 가장 비슷하게 따르도록 직선방정식h(x) 를 찾는다. 그것은 적절한 \\theta_0 \\theta_1을 찾는것인데, 어림짐작으로는 찾을수 없다. \\theta_0 \\theta_1 에 임의의 모든 값을 대입해봐서 cost function 을 구했을때 가장 낮은 값을 갖는 \\theta_0 \\theta_1 을 선택하면 된다. 목적은 Cost Function을 최소화 하는것이다. Cost Function이 작아질 수록 Hypothesis Function의 정확도는 향상된다.    \n  \nh_\\theta(x) 정확도 \\propto {1 \\over J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)}    \n  \n1.2.5. Simplified Cost function of Linear Regression\n가설/비용함수 개념을 더 잘 이해하기 위해서 우리는 \\theta_0 를 0으로 만든 단순화 버전을 사용할 것이다.  단순화 시킨 h_\\theta(x) 의 그래프는 원점을 지난다. 정리하면 다음과 같다.     \n\n\n\n\nbasic\nsimplified\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x \n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_1 \n\n\nParametears:\n \\theta_0 , \\theta_1 \n \\theta_1 \n\n\nCost Function:\n J(\\theta_0 , \\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \n J(\\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \n\n\nGoal:\n \\underset{\\theta_0 , \\theta_1}{minimize} \\ J(\\theta_0 , \\theta_1) \n \\underset{\\theta_1}{minimize} \\ J(\\theta_1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n가설함수  h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_1 \n비용함수   J(\\theta_1) \n\n\n\n\ninput값 x 에 대한 함수\nparameter \\theta 에 대한 함수 (직선의 기울기를 좌우함)\n\n\n\n단순화된 버전으로 다음의 예를 살펴보자.  다음과 같은 Training Data가 주어졌다고 하자.     \n    \n\n먼저 실제 데이터(Training data) X가 x-y평면에 흩뿌려져 있다.(그림과 다르게 더 불규칙할 수 있음) 우리 목적은 최대한 그 데이터를 잘 모사 할 수 있는 직선h_\\theta(x)을 찾는것이다.     \n\n이제 \\theta_1의 값에 따른 가설함수와 cost 함수의 관계가 어떻게 변화하는지 살펴보자.     \n\\theta_1 = 1 일때\n결론적으로 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 은 실제 데이터(Training data)와 정확히 일치하게 되고, 이 예시 데이터에서  J(1) 은  0으로 우리의 목적인 최소값이 된다. (예측값 - 실제값)이 0이 된다.     \n    \n\n그래프 설명: 왼쪽의 plot X는 \"실제 값\"(Training data)이다. 거기에 \"예측 값\"인 h_\\theta(x) 을 그렸다.우측: \\theta_1 = 1 일때  J(\\theta_1)  값은 0이 된다.   J(1) = 0  이다.그리고 h_\\theta(x) = x 가 된다. 실제 데이터도 y=x 를 따라 위치해있으므로 두 데이터가 정확히 일치한다.가령 집 크기가 2일때 예측한 짒값은 2인데 실제 집값도 2이다. 라는 의미    \n\n실제 데이터가 y=x 를 따라 무한히 주어지지는 않을 테지만, 비용함수 계산 결과 0으로 나오므로 여기서 우리가 선택한 직선인 h_\\theta(x) 는 실세계를 정확히 거의 예측할 수 있는 것이다. 결국 Linear Regression은 실제 이미 알고있는 유한한 데이터를 기반으로 모르는 값을 예측/추측 할때 사용한다.     \n    \n\n질문: (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 에서 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 의 결과는 예측값이고 y^{(i)}는 실제 값이다. 그런데 아래 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 그래프에서 y축은 예측값이지 실제 값이 아니지 않은가?     \n그래프에서 y 축은 실제값을 나타내는게 맞다. h_\\theta(x^{(i)})가 찍는 그래프는 y에 대한 예측값을 찍는것이다. 반면 X로 표기된 값이 실제 값이다.  여기서 설명하는 linear regression은 supervised learning이기 때문에 주어진 training set(data set)의 y값 즉 정답을 이미 다 알고있다는 가정하에 한다. 따라서 (예측값-실제값)이 맞다.\\theta_1가 1일때는 예측 모델(?) 예측값이 실제값과 동일해진다는것을 설명한 것이다.따라서 실제 training set과 h 그래프는 위와 같이 표현되는게 더 정확하다.위 연습문제를 계산해보면 결과는 아래와 같음    \n  \n\\begin{matrix}    \nJ(0) &=& {1 \\over 2 \\times 3} \\times ((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 +(0 - 3)^2) \\\\    \n   &=& {14 \\over 6}     \n\\end{matrix}    \n  \n\n\\theta_1 = 0.5 일때\n    \n\n가령 집 크기(x)가 2일때 예측한 짒값(y)은 1이었는데, 실제 집값은 2었다는 의미    \n\n\\theta_1 = 0 그리고  \\theta_1 = n일때\n    \n1.2.6. Cost function of Linear Regression\n이제 \\theta_0 를 사용한 실제 Cost function 을 살펴보자. \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 이 모두 존재하기 때문에 Cost function  J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  는 그림과 같이 3차원 그래프가 될 것이다.    \n3차원 그래프는 아래 우측과 같이 보기편하게 Countour plot(등고선 그래프)으로 변경해서 사용할것이다. 위에서 내려다 본 모습과 일치하고 같은 등고선은 같은 높이의  J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) 를 의미한다.    \n우측 그래프의 빨간점 x 는 \\theta_0 = 800  \\theta_1 = -1.5 인데 이값으로 h_\\theta(x) = 800 -1.5x 을 그려보면 좌측과 같다. 실제 데이터(training data) X plot을 전혀 따라가고 있지 못하다.  J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  의 값또한 최소값(중심부) 에서 멀리 떨어져있기 때문에 꽤 높은 비용을 쓰고 있다.     \n따라서 더 좋은 Hypothesis function h는 Cost function J의 최소값과 비슷할 수록 더 좋다. 참고로 앞으로는 더 많은 parameter \\theta를 사용할것이다. 그렇게 되면 더이상 그래프로는 표현할 수 없다. 더 많은 parameter \\theta를 사용한다는 의미는 h_\\theta(x) 함수 형태가 더 복잡해진다는 의미이다. 이것은 실제 데이터를 더욱 정확히 반영할 것이다. 결국 우리가 해야할 것은 S/W를 사용해서  \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 그리고 함수 J의 최소값을 찾는것이다. 이제 J가 최소화 되도록 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1을 자동으로  찾는 알고리즘에 대해 알아보자.  \n1.2.7. Parameter Learning (Gradient Descent)\n\n지금까지 hypothesis function, h 에 대해 알아보았고 cost function을 통해 h의 parameter(\\theta)값에 따라 실제 세계의 데이터(training data)를 얼마나 잘 반영하는지 측정하는 방법에 대해 알아보았다. 이전 장에서 \\theta 값에 따라 h의 정확도가 어떻게 향상되는지는 알아봤지만, 어떻게 \\theta 값을 찾는지는 아직 모른다. 이번에는 가장 적합한 hypothesis function의 공식을 구성하는 parameter(\\theta)들을 어떻게 추정(estimate) 하는지 알아본다. Gradient Descent 알고리즘 이다.  \n1.2.8. Gradient Descent 알고리즘 수학적 정의\nGradient Descent알고리즘은 Cost function, J() 의 최소값을 찾기 위해 사용할 수 있다.  Gradient Descent 알고리즘은 Linear Regression 에만 쓸 수 있는건 아니고, 범용적인 알고리즘이다.     \n\n기본 아이디어     \n어떤 값으로 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 를 초기화하여 시작한다 (보통 0)    \nJ(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)를 최소화 하는 방향으로 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1를 변화시킨다. (J가 최소값이 될때 까지)\n초기 지점부터 최소 지점으로 내려가야 한다. 어떻게 내려가는지 여러가지 알고리즘이 존재한다.어느 지점에서 시작을 하느냐에 따라 어떤 지점으로 도착할지가 다를 수 있다.참고 이 그래프와는 다르게 Linear regression에서는 cost function J의 최소점이 무조건 1개이다.    \n\n\n\n\n\n공식은 다음과 같다. \n    \n공식 해설    \n\n:=수학에서 기호 := 할당한다(assignment)의 의미이다.a := b, a := a + 1 은 컴퓨터 프로그래밍에서 변수에 값을 할당하는것과 동일하다.반면 a = b 는 주장(assertion)이다. a와 b가 같다고 주장하는 것이다. (컴퓨터 프로그램과 반대) 따라서 a = a + 1 는 틀린 공식이 된다. 왜냐하면 a와 a + 1은 절대 같은 값이 될 수 없기 때문이다.     \n\n\\alphaLearning Rate (훈련 비율) 수치 이다. 기본적으로 언덕을 내려갈 때 얼만큼 큰 걸음을 내 딛어야하는지를 상징한다. 가령  \\alpha가 크다면 매우 aggresive한 기울기 하강이 될것    \n\n{\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_j}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)생긴것 그대로 \\theta에 대한 함수 J의 미분 계수 이다. \\partial - 편미분. 하강 방향은 J의 편미분값에 의해 결정된다.     \n\n(for j = 0 and j = 1)여기서는 j가 0일 때와 1일때를 다룬다.  \n\n\n이 공식을 update하기 위해서 아래의 과정을 통해 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 이 지속적으로 업데이트 되야한다.     \n temp0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha{\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_0}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  temp1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha{\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_1}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) \\theta_0 := temp0\\theta_1 := temp1    \n\ntemp0 temp1을 먼저 계산한뒤 \\theta 에 할당하는 이유는 temp1 에서 미분계수를 계산할때 바뀐 \\theta_0 를 사용하지 않기 위함임을 주의해야한다.     \n\n1.2.9. Learning rate와 미분계수\n이번에도 더 쉬운 이해를 위해 \\theta_0 을 사용하지않고 parameter 하나만 사용, J(\\theta_1) 으로 단순화 시켜보자.    \n\n미분계수 {\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_j}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)그래프의 빨간점 지점의 J(\\theta_1)의 미분계수는 어떠한 양수값이다. 따라서 \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha (양수값) 을 계산하면 \\theta_1은 점차 최저 J 값으로 이동하게 된다.미분계수가 음수인경우도 마찬가지로 \\theta_1이 점차 최저 J 값으로 이동하게 된다.     \n\nLearning Rate \\alpha\\alpha 가 작다면 매우 작은 스텝으로 하강할것이고 많은 이동이 필요하다. 하강 속도가 느릴것이다.만약 \\alpha 이 큰데 시작점이 최소값 지점과 가까이 있다면 최소값을 넘어서 반대방향으로 이동할 것이고 또다시 반대편으로 이동하게 될것이다. minimum 을 Overshoot하게 되는것이다. 방향 전환 조차도 실패한다. 결국 수렴(converge) 에서 멀어지게 된다.     \n\n문제: 만약 parameter \\theta_1 이 이미 최소값이라면 어떤 각도로 하강해야할까?미분계수가 0 이기 때문에 그대로 \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - 0  이 되어 변동이 없다.\n하강할 수록 점점 더 작은 거리를 이동하게 된다. 왜냐하면 최소값에 도달할수록 기울기가 작아지며 미분계수값이 작아지기 때문이다. 따라서 굳이 \\alpha값이 작아질 필요가 없다.     \n\n\n1.2.10. Gradient Descent for Linear Regression\n이제 Gradient Descent를 Linear Regression에 적용해보자.     \n    \n이제 우리가 하려는 것은 Gradient Descent 알고리즘을 사용해서 J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)를 최소화 하려는 것이다. Cost function J()를 알고리즘 공식에 대입하기만 하면 된다. 먼저 아래와 같이 알고리즘에서 미분계수 항 {\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_j}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) 에 대입하여 (a)로 풀어쓴뒤,  j=0, j=1일때 각각 편미분하면 \\theta_0  \\theta_1에 대한 미분계수 (b), (c)를 구할 수 있다.    \n이것을 Gradient Descent 알고리즘에 다시 대입하면 아래와 같다. 이제 \\theta_0  \\theta_1 값을 계산할 수 있는 알고리즘이 공식화 되었다.  \n\\begin{align*} \\text{repeat until convergence: } \\lbrace & \\newline \\theta_0 := & \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i}) \\newline \\theta_1 := & \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}\\left((h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i}) x_{i}\\right) \\newline \\rbrace& \\end{align*}    \n  \n초기에 주어진 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 을 가지고 모든 training set의 h(x^i) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x^i 와 y차의 합을 구한다. 공식에 따라 먼저 \\theta_0, \\theta_1에 해당하는 값을 구한뒤 그다음에 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 에 각각 대입한다. 그렇게 두번째 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 값을 구할 수 있는것이다. 이것을 반복하다보면 아래 그림과 같이 cost function J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)가 최소값이 되는 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 지점에 점차 수렴하게 된다(목적 달성). 당연히 \\theta_0, \\theta_1가 바뀔때마다 hypotheis function h(x)도 달라진다. (주의할 사항은 이 두값이 동시에(simultaneously) update 되어야한다는 점이다 \\theta_0, \\theta_1이 바뀔때 마다 가설 함수도 바뀌기 때문이다.  h(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x)    \n    \n이 알고리즘을 다른말로 Batch Gradient Descent 라고 부른다. 지금 배운것은 cost function J의 최소값을 구하기 위해 반복적 알고리즘을 사용했다. 참고로 나중에는 반복이 없이도 J의 최소값을 구할 수 있는 방법에 대해 알아볼 것이다. 이로써 Gradient Descent 알고리즘이라는 첫번째 기계학습 알고리즘을 배웠다.      \n참고1: (a) -> (c) 편미분 풀이과정참고2: Linear regression에서는 cost function J의 최소점이 무조건 1개이다. 그래프의 모양은 bowl-shape이다. 이를  convex quadratic function 이라고 부름.    \n"},"documents/1.3-linear-algebra-review.html":{"url":"documents/1.3-linear-algebra-review.html","title":"1.3.

Multivariate Linear Regression\n\n이번 챕터에서는 하나 이상의 variable 또는 하나 이상의 feature를 사용하는 보다 강력한 Linear regression에 대해 알아볼 것이다.     \n2.1.1. Multiple Features\n지금까지는 x (집 크기) 라는 하나의 feature만 사용했다. 이것을 집의 가격을 결정(예측)하는 요소로 사용했다. 그런데 집값을 결정짓는 요소는 집 크기하나 말고도 더 많을 수 있다. 이럴때 Linear regrresion을 어떻게 할수 있을까? 다음의 예시처럼 집의 크기와 방의 갯수, 층수, 연식 등등으로 고려해서 집값을 예측(결정) 할 수 있을 것이다. 침실 수, 층 수, 연식, 가격이라는 4개의 feature를 이용해 집값을 예측해 볼 것이다.   \n    \n일단 먼저 새로운 notation은 다음과 같이 약속한다. 참고로 이런 notation은 machine learning 강의마다 다르다.       \n    \n이 예시에서 4개의 feature가 있으므로 n = 4이다. (m은 테이블의 행의 갯수(training data의 갯수)임에 유의) 여기서 x^{(2)}는 두번째 training set(두번째 행)의 데이터를 가진 4차원 vector다. 다시말해 두번째 집의 가격을 결정짓는 요소들이다. 추가로 아래첨자는 feature 번호다. 가령 x^{(2)}_3는 테이블에서 2를 가리킨다.x^{(2)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1416 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 40 \\end{bmatrix}   \n그리고 feature가 1개에서 4개로 늘어났으므로 Hypothesis function의 형태도 달라져야한다. 이전에   h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x \\\\      였다면 이번에는   h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_2 + \\theta_3x_3 + \\theta_4x_4    를 사용할것이다. 가령 이 예제에서 hypothesis function은   h_\\theta(x) = 80 + 0.1x_1 + 0.01x_2 + 3x_3 - 2x_4 와 같을 수 있다. (\\theta_4 가 -2인 이유는 집이 오래될 수록 집값은 떨어지기 때문이다. ) 결국 h_\\theta(x) 에서 \\theta_j는 feature x_j에대한 가중치라고 볼수 있다. 따라서 n개의 feature가 있다면 가설함수는 아래와 같다.     \n    \nFeature 벡터 X와 parameter 벡터 \\theta가 있다.  결국 X는 n차원 벡터고 \\theta 도 만찬가지로 n차원 벡터다.  이 두 벡터를 곱하면 h_\\theta(x) 가 된다. 곱셈의 편의를 위해서 \\theta 벡터는 transpose 한다. (nx1, nx1 끼리는 곱셈불가하기 때문에  1xn * nx1 의 형태로 변경해야함) 따라서 hypothesis function 을 벡터화(vectorization)하면  h_\\theta(x) = \\theta^TX  같이 간략히 표현된다.    \n  \n\\begin{align*}h_\\theta(x) =\\begin{bmatrix}\\theta_0 \\hspace{2em} \\theta_1 \\hspace{2em} ... \\hspace{2em} \\theta_n\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline \\vdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix}= \\theta^T x\\end{align*}    \n  \n이것을 Multivariate Linear regression 이라고 부른다. 다변수 선형회귀도 궁극적으로 해결하려는 것은 training set의 데이터를 가지고 \\theta_n 들을 구하는 것이다. 그 \\theta 로 이루어진 h_\\theta()는 training set을 가장 유사하게 모사하는함수다. 여기서도 cost function J()를 새롭게 정의하게 될것이다.  \n2.1.2. Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables\n변수가 여러개인 linear regression 의 Gradient Descent 는 어떻게 할까? 아래 공식과 같다. cost function 자체는 동일하다. 여기서 여러개의 parameter \\theta_0 ... \\theta_n 는 모두 간단하게 벡터 \\theta 로 바꿔서 표기할 수있다.    \nfeature가 1개 이상일때 Gradient Descent 알고리즘을 아래와같고 결국 각 \\theta 는 그 아래와같이 계산 될 수 있다. 개념상 이해하는데는 feature 가 1개일때랑 크게 차이가 없다.      \n    \n우리가 최종 계산할 parameter \\theta_0 ... \\theta_n 계산 공식!    \n  \n\\begin{align*} & \\text{repeat until convergence:} \\; \\lbrace \\newline \\; & \\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_0^{(i)}\\newline \\; & \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_1^{(i)} \\newline \\; & \\theta_2 := \\theta_2 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_2^{(i)} \\newline & \\cdots \\newline \\rbrace \\end{align*}    \n  \n2.1.3. Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling\nFeature Scaling 이란? 만약 여러개의 feature가 비슷한 크기의 범위를 갖는 값이라면 Gradient Descent가 더 빠르게 수렴할 수 있다.  더 적은 수의 반복으로 목적지에 수렴이 가능하다.     \n가령 x_1 값이 0 ~ 2000 의 범위를 갖고 x_2는 1 ~ 5 의 범위를 갖는다고 가정하면 그 두개의 feature의 범위 차이가 매우 크기 때문에 왼쪽 처럼 등고선이 매우 길쭉하게 나타난다. 그러면 기울기 하강은 더 난해하고 복잡한 경로로 오랫동안 일어나게 된다. 만약 우측처럼 범위를 동일하게 맞춰주면 등고선의 모양은 거의 원형이라 더 빠르게 하강할 수 있다. 따라서 이렇게 각 feature의 scale을 비슷하게 조정할 필요가 있다. (정확하게 똑같이 맞출필요는없다. 대충 비슷하게만 맞으면 된다.)  이것이 이번장에서 다룰 Feature Scaling이다.     \n    \n\nFeature Scaling 기법중 하나는 Mean normalization이다. 이것은 x를 대략 -0.5 ~ 0.5 범위로 scale 시킨다. 방법은     \n\n  \nx_n := {x_n - \\mu_n \\over s_n}    \n  \n\n\\mu_1 은 x_1의 평균이다.s_1 은 보통 최대값-최소값으로 하면된다.     \n\n2.1.4. Gradient Descent in Practice II - Learning Rate\n이번에는 learning rate \\alpha를 어떻게 정하는지 알아본다.     \nGradient Descent가 잘동작한다면 j()는 매 iteration마다 감소해야한다. 300 회 반복 부터는 cost function 이 거의 줄어들지 않고 수렴한다. Gradient Descent 가 수렴하는 iteration 횟수는? 경우에 따라 다양하기 때문에 사전에 알기 어렵다.  Automatic Convergence Test라는 Gradient Descent 가 수렴하는지 안하는지 알려주는 test가 존재 하기도 한다. 만약 J 가 감소하지 않고 증가한다면 명백한 문제가 있는것이고, 더 작은 learning rate \\alpha 사용해야한다는 뜻이다. 적절한 learning rate \\alpha 알아서 찾아서 좋은 Gradient Descent를 구현해야한다. 특별히 정답은 없는듯.    \nTo summarize:    \n\nIf \\alphaα is too small: slow convergence.    \nIf \\alphaα is too large: ￼may not decrease on every iteration and thus may not converge.    \n\n2.1.5. Features and Polynomial Regression\n이번에는 어떻게 Feature를 선택할지, 적절한 Feature의 선택으로 강력한 학습 알고리즘을 만드는 방법에대해 알아본다. Polynomial Regression(다항 회귀?)에 대해서도 알아본다.  Polynomial Regression은 linear regression 을이용해서 복잡한 비선형 함수에도 적용하는 것이다.     \n    \n이런경우는 굳이 x_2 까지 항을 늘려서 모델(가설함수)을 만들 필요가 없다. x_1을 넓이로 바로 사용해도 된다.     \n위와같은 형태의 training data가 존재한다고 하자. hypothesis function이 h_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1  일 때, x1 에 연관된 feature를 추가하여 2차 함수꼴로 만들 수 있다.  \nh_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^2    \n여기서 \\theta_2 x_1^2 가 x_2^2 가 아니라 x_1^2 임을 유의하자. 결국 feature는 하나인것이다. 하나의 feature를 가지고 제곱이나 제곱근등등으로 형태를 변경하여 함수모양을 바꿀수 있다. 이것은 결국 feature가 하나 더 늘어나는것과 같은 의미이다. 결국 x_1 = x_1, x_2 = (x_1)^2 와 같다. 이차함수형태의 모델을 사용하면 나중에 감소하는 구간이 생기기에 적합하지 않다. 이럴땐 3차 함수 형태를 사용하는게 더 적합하다.   h_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^3 + \\theta_3 x_1^3    이렇게 3차 함수꼴로 나타냈을때 그리고 아래와 같이 제곱근 형태의 함수를 사용하는게 더 적합할 수도 있다.   h_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 \\sqrt{x_1}    이러한 함수형태를 자동으로 찾아주는 알고리즘이 존재한다. 앞으로는 그것을 사용할것이다. \n이렇게 feature 하나를 가지고 새로운 feature를 만들면 feature scaling이 중요해진다. x_1이 1~1000 범위를 갖는다면, 그로부터 만든 새 feature인 (x_1)^2는 1 ~ 1000000 의 범위를 갖게 될것이기 때문이다. 이 둘의 차이가 너무 크면 gradient descent 가 엄청 느려진다.     \n\nPolynomial feature  생성하는 방법:만약 training data의 feature가  x_1  x_2 이렇게 주어진다면, 그 두개의 feature 벡터를 가지고 다음의 polynomial feature 값을 모두 연산하여 새로운 matrix를 생성한다. 그리고 각 polynomial feature에 해당하는 가중치  \\theta 를 적절하게 선택(Gredient descent등 사용)하여, Polynomial한 h_\\theta(x) 함수를 생성할 수 있는것이다.  \nx_1 , x_2 , x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1x_2, x_1^3, x_1^2x_2, x_1x_2^2 , x_2^3, ....  \nTraining set을 가지고 그 데이터를 잘 모사하는 h_\\theta(x)를 만들때, 함수형태를 먼저 찾는것이 아니다. 모든 형태를 만든다음에  x 의 parameter (혹은 weight)  \\theta를 0으로 만들던지 하여 불필요한 항을 제거하는 방식으로 함수 형태를 찾는것이다.    \n\nPolynomial feature  생성 알고리즘(in Octave):연습문제 ex2_reg.m 의 mapFeature.m 참고  \n  X = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2));\n\n\nx_1, x_2a feature가 X벡터에 있을때  \n\n  function out = mapFeature(X1, X2)  \n\n  degree = 6;        % 몇차 polynomial feature까지 생성할 것인지  \n  out = ones(size(X1(:,1)));  \n  for i = 1:degree  \n      for j = 0:i  \n      out(:, end+1) = (X1.^(i-j)).*(X2.^j);  \n      end  \n  end  \n  end\n\n\n\n"},"documents/2.2-computing-parameters-analytically.html":{"url":"documents/2.2-computing-parameters-analytically.html","title":"2.2.

Computing Parameters Analytically\n\n2.2.1. Normal Equation\nNormal Equation은 최적의 \\theta 를 구할 수 있는 또다른 방법이다.  Gradient Descent 와는 다른 방식으로 각각 장/단점이 있다. Normal Equation은 \\theta 를 반복계산 없이 공식하나로 한번에 구할 수 있다. 다음의 training set을 보자.     \n    \n4개의 feature가 있고 결과가 있다. 이것을 각각 X matrix와 y 벡터로 복사한다. 계산의 편의를 위해  1을 갖는 x_0 열이 추가되었음에 유의. 이것을가지도 아래 Normal Equation 공식에 대입해 계산하면 다음과 같이 바로 \\theta를 구할 수 있다. 이렇게 계산된 \\theta 는 cost function J를 최소화하는 값이다.     \n  \n\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty    \n  \n    \n만약 i번째 하나의 training data가 위의 x^{(i)} 처럼 n + 1 크기의 벡터로 주어진다면, 이것으로 우측과 같이 Design Matrix X를 만든다. (결국 이전 예시처럼 테이블을 그대로 matrix에 복사한것과 동일한 구성임) 더 간단한 예를들면 아래와 같다.    \n    \n\\theta 를 구하는 Octave 명령어    \npinv(X'*X)*X'*y\n\n반복 계산도 필요없고 적절한 \\alpha를 찾아야하는 수고가 없다. 또한 Feature scaling도 필요없다. 이렇게 좋은 방법이 있다니? 그러나 결론적으로Normal Equation에 매우 치명적인 단점이 있다. n(feature갯수)가 엄청 커지면 Normal Equation은 못쓴다. 복잡도가 O(n^3) 으로 연산속도가 엄청나게 느려지기 때문이다.     \nGradient descent 와 Normal equation을 비교하면 아래와 같다.    \n보통 n=10000 정도까지는 Normal equations을 사용해도 괜찮다고 한다. 현대 컴퓨팅 파워로 이정도계산 까지는 실용적인 속도를 얻을 수 있다.     \n2.2.2. Normal Equation Noninvertibility\n역행렬이 없는 Normal Equation은 어떻게 구해야할까?  \n\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty    \nX^TX 가 역행렬이 없는 경우가 있기 때문이다.     \n다음의 두가지 경우에 X^TX 에 역행렬이 없다.1번은 각 feature가 x_1 = (3.28)^2x_2 처럼 선형적으로 종속적인 관계일때이다. 이럴땐 둘 중 한feature를 제거해도 된다. 두번째는 피쳐갯수(n)이 training set갯수(m)보다 많을때이다. 이럴땐 어떤 feature들을 지우거나, regularization기법을 사용한다.      \n"},"documents/3-logistic-regression-regularization.html":{"url":"documents/3-logistic-regression-regularization.html","title":"3.

(용어는 Regression 이지만 Classfication 문제임)  \n  \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta (x) = g ( \\theta^T x ) \\newline \\newline& z = \\theta^T x \\newline& g(z) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\\end{align*}  \n  \n그렇게 하기 위해서는 가설함수 h_\\theta(x)를 g(z) 형태로 변화시켜야한다. 그 이유는 0 \\leq h_\\theta(x) \\leq 1를 만족시키도록 만들기 위해서이다. 그래프로 그리면 시그모이드 함수의 형태로 나타나고 범위가 1이하 0이상을 만족한다. 이제 우리가할일은 \\theta 파라미터를 우리의 데이터에 맞게 맞추는것이다. 파라미터를 찾는 알고리즘은 후에 다시 살펴본다.   \n  \ng(z)의 결과는 항상 0 이상 1이하를 만족한다.  \nh(x)는 입력값 x에대해서 y가 1일 확률을 추청하는 함수이다. 가령 위그림과 같이 x의 feature가 두개 즉 feature 벡터 x가 있을때. (하나는 1, 하나는 종양크기) 만약 가설함수가 0.7로 나왔다면, 결과를 이렇게 해석할 수 있다. y=1일 확률 즉 악성종양일 확률이 70%이라고. 이것을 수학적으로 더 엄밀하게 표현하면 아래와 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \\theta) = 1 - P(y=0 | x ; \\theta) \\newline&  \nP(y = 0 | x;\\theta) + P(y = 1 | x ; \\theta) = 1\\end{align*}  \n  \n\nh_\\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \\theta)  해석: Probability that y=1, given x, parameterized by \\thetay가 1일 가능성, 주어진 x, 즉 환자가 특징 x로 나타내지는 특정 종양의 크기를 가질때, 이것이 \\theta에 매개된 가능성이다.   \n\n3.1.3. Decision Boundary\n\nh(x)가 계산하는것이 정확히 무엇이냐? 가설함수가 예측하는 값이 언제 y=1이고 0인지 이해해보자.   \n  \n가령 h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 일때 y = 1이라고 가정한다면, h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta^T x) \\geq 0.5  와 같다. 그래프를 보면 z \\geq 0일때 g(z) \\geq 0.5이므로 z = \\theta^Tx \\geq 0 일때 와 같다. 즉 \\theta^Tx \\geq 0 이면, y = 1 로 예측할 수 있다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 \\rightarrow y = 1 \\newline& h_\\theta(x)   \n  \n가령 h(x) 가 위처럼 g(\\theta^Tx) 형태일때, \\theta 벡터가  \\theta = \\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} 라고 가정하면, \\theta^Tx  가 0보다 큰 경우, 즉 y=1일 경우는 그래프가 나타태는 영역과 같다. x_1 x_2는 training set이다.  x_1 + x_2 \\geq 0 이 나타내는 영역이 y=1인것이다.  이때 h(x) = g(\\theta^Tx) \\geq 0.5를 만족한다. 이 경계를 나타내는 함수를 Decision Boundary 라고 부른다. (The decision boundary is the line that separates the area where y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function.) \n실제로(x_1, x_2)이 (1,1)과 (3,3)일때 h_\\theta(x)를 계산해보면 다음과 같다.   \n\n(3,3)일때 -> \\theta^Tx = 3  \n  octave:6> 1 / (1 + e^-(3))  \n  ans =  0.95257\n\n\n0.5보다 큼 -> y=1 일확률 95%  \n\n\n(1,1)일때 -> \\theta^Tx = -1  \n  octave:7> 1 / (1 + e^-(-1))  \n  ans =  0.26894\n\n\n0.5보다 작음 -> y=1 일 확률 27%  \n\n\n\n3.1.4. Non-linear Decision Boundary\n\n  \n일반적인 경우 logistic regression은 linear한 decision boundary 밖에 찾을 수 없다. (since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary) 따라서 Decision Boundary가 non-linear한 경우의 예는 위와 같다. (\\theta^Tx) 는 feature 두개를(x_1 x_2) 가지고Polynomial 한 변수를 사용했음에 유의(x_1^2 x_2^2). \\theta가 Decision Boundary 모양을 결정한다 training data가 하는게 아니다.  \nPolynomial 한 feature를 더 복합적으로 사용하면 더 복잡한 모양의 Decision Boundary를 얻을 수 있다. 결국 이 3 장에서 할일은. training set x가 있을때 적절한 Decision Boundary함수 그래프 모형(?)을 선택하고 \\theta 를 구한다. 최적의 \\theta는 당연히도 cost function J(\\theta)를 최소화하는 값으로 구할것이다. 그렇게 해서 구해진 가설함수 h_\\theta(x)는 주어진 x가 y=1영역인지 아닌지를 판단해준다. 확률값으로.  \n3.1.5. Cost function\n\n이제 어떻게 적절한 parameter \\theta를 계산할 수 있는지 알아본다. m개의 Training set과, feature 벡터 x 가 아래와 같을때.  \\theta를 어떻게 선택할 수 있을까?  \n  \nLogistic regression의 cost function 은 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& J(\\theta) = \\dfrac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(h_\\theta(x)) \\; & \\text{if y = 1} \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(1-h_\\theta(x)) \\; & \\text{if y = 0}\\end{align*}  \n  \n\ny=1일때, y=0일때 다르다.   \n\nJ(\\theta)는 training examples의 모든 i에 대한 합이고 하나의 i에 해당하는 Cost(h_\\theta(x), y)는 예시는 아래와 같다. 참고로 Linear regression에서 cost function은 \"실제값과 예측값의 차이\"였다. Logistic regression 에서는 log함수 형태를 선택했다. 예측값(y= 0또는 1)이 실제값(y= 0또는 1)과 가까우면 0이고 틀리면 무한대가 된다. 결국 개념상 예측값(h_\\theta(x), y=1일 확률값) 과 실제값(y)의 차이인것은 동일하다.  Logistic regression은 실제값 y가 0또는 1밖에 없기 때문에 cost func를 두개로 나눌수 있는것.   \n참고: m개의 training data가 필요한 시점은 언제부터 인가? 다시 말해 m개의 데이터를 통해 학습하는 단계는 언제부터인가?-> Cost function J(\\theta)를 계산하는 시점이다. J(\\theta)는 각 training set으로 부터 계산된 값을 모두 더해야하기 때문이다. 이 지점을 Learning 한다고 표현하는것 같다.   \n만약 y=1일때 cost function J(\\theta)는 아래와 같이 그릴 수 있다. x축인 h_\\theta(x) 의 범위는 0 에서 1사이이다.  \n반대로 y=0일때는 다음과 같다.  \n만약 y=1로 예측을 하는 cost 함수에서 h_\\theta(x) = 0 이 나오면 대단한 오류이기 때문에 cost즉 J(\\theta)가 무한대이다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = 0 \\text{ if } h_\\theta(x) = y \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 0 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 1 \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 1 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 0 \\newline \\end{align*}  \n  \n3.1.6. Simplified Cost Function and Gradient Descent\n\nCost Function\ny=1일때와 0일때 경우로 나뉜 cost function은 아래와같이 하나의 식으로 합칠수 있다. y=1과 y=0을 대입해보면 동일하다.  \n그리고 J(\\theta)는 아래와 같은 공식으로 나타낼 수 있다.   \n  \n이것을 Vectorized 하면 아래와 같다. 실제 Octave로 계산할때는 아래의 식을 사용한다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*} & h = g(X\\theta)\\newline & J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\left(-y^{T}\\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\\log(1-h)\\right) \\end{align*}  \n  \nGredient Descent 알고리즘.\n\\theta_j 를 구하는 알고리즘도 아래와 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline & \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta) \\newline & \\rbrace\\end{align*}  \n  \n편미분해서 도함수(Derivative)를 대입하면   \n  \n\\begin{align*} & Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline & \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)} \\newline & \\rbrace \\end{align*}  \n  \n결국 Gredient Descent 알고리즘이 Linear regression과 완벽히 동일 하다! (각 \\theta 값은 동시에(simultaniously) 계산되어야하는 것도 마찬가지)  \n  \n\nLinear regression 과 딱하나 차이가 있다면 h_\\theta(x) 의 형태이다.   \n\nLinear regression: \nh_\\theta(x) = \\theta^Tx    \nLogistic regression: \nh_\\theta(x) = {1 \\over (1 + e^{-\\theta^Tx})}  \n\n\n결국 Vectorized 하면  \\theta는 아래와 같이 구할 수 있다.    \n  \n3.1.7. Advanced Optimization\n\nFor logistic regression, sometimes gradient descent will converge to a local minimum (and fail to find the global minimum). This is the reason we prefer more advanced optimization algorithms such as fminunc (conjugate gradient/BFGS/L-BFGS/etc). Octave 라이브러리 fminunc() 사용, theta vector를 Gradient descent보다 빨리 찾을 수 있음. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/cmjIc/advanced-optimization  \n3.1.8. Multi-Class Classification\n\n아래 예와 같이, 이메일을 여러 태그로 분류하는 경우등, 두개 이상으로 분류하는 경우는 어떻게 하는지 알아보자.   \n  \n아래와 같이, 3가지로 분류해야 한다면, One vs All 형태의 가설함수를 3개를 만들면 된다. 그뒤에 예측할때는 x에대해서 세개의 가설함수 전부를 돌려보고 결과인 y=1일 확률이 가장 높은 class로 선택하면 된다.   \n  \n이것을 수식으로 표현하면  \n  \n\\begin{align*}& y \\in \\lbrace0, 1 ... n\\rbrace \\newline& h_\\theta^{(0)}(x) = P(y = 0 | x ; \\theta) \\newline& h_\\theta^{(1)}(x) = P(y = 1 | x ; \\theta) \\newline& \\cdots \\newline& h_\\theta^{(n)}(x) = P(y = n | x ; \\theta) \\newline& \\mathrm{prediction} = \\max_i( h_\\theta ^{(i)}(x) )\\newline\\end{align*}  \n  \n\nh_\\theta^{(0)}(x) 부터  h_\\theta^{(n)}(x) 까지 다 돌려보고 그중에 가장 큰값을 갖는 i를 선택하면 된다.    \n\n"},"documents/3.2-regularization-and-overfitting-problem.html":{"url":"documents/3.2-regularization-and-overfitting-problem.html","title":"3.2.

Overfitting problem\n\n3.2.1. Overfitting 이란?\n  \nFeature를 많이 둘 수록 Training data을 더 정확히 모사할 수 있다.  하지만 가설함수가 너무 Training data에만 적합해서 Training data는 거의 정확하게 예측하지만 새로 들어온 데이터에 대해서는 예측을 못하는 문제가 발생할수 있다.  해당 가설함수로 문제를 일반화(generalize)하는것을 실패함. 그림맨 왼쪽은 Underfit (high bias, preconception 이라고도 표현할수 있음), 오른쪽이 Overfit, 가운데가 적합함. 강의 뒷편에서 학습알고리즘이 Overfitting인지 아닌지 분석하는 툴에대해 살펴볼 것이다.   \nFeature가 너무 많을때 Overfitting이 발생할 수 있다. 해결책은 크게 두가지이다.   \n\n1) Reduce the number of features:  \n\nManually select which features to keep.  \nUse a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).  \n\n\n2) Regularization  \n\nKeep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters \\theta_jθ   \nRegularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.이번 장에서 다룰 내용  \n\n\n\n3.2.2. Cost function\n  \nRegularization 은 이렇게 cost function 에 특정\\theta_j에 큰 가중치를 부여(패널티 부여)해서 최종적으로 \\theta_j 의 크기를 0에 가깝게 만드는것이다. 이렇게하면 4차 함수를 쓰더라도 2차함수 모델에 근접하게 만들 수 있다.   \n  \n그렇다면 어떤 \\theta_i를 선택해서 Regularization할 것인가? 우리는 어떤게 맞는지 알수없다. 그래서  다음의 공식으로 모든 parameter  \\theta_i에 대해서 값을 줄여(shrink)서 cost function값을 확인해 보는 것이다.  J(\\theta) 의 공식에 \\color{royalblue}{+ \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2} 부분이 추가된다.   \nIn regularized linear regression, we choose \\theta to minimize:   \n\nJ(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( h_\\theta( x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \\right)^2 \\color{royalblue}{+ \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2} \n\nThe \\lambda is the regularization parameter. It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated. 어떤 \\lambda를 적용 했을때, 모든 \\theta에대해서 가장 cost function이 작아지는지 확인? 어떤 feature에 대한 parameter \\theta_j 가 있을때 그 파라미터에대해서  J(\\theta)를 구해보면, 왼쪽항은 줄어들지만, 람다항 + \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2은 커진다. 이 둘의 조합을 통해 결국 가장 작은 값을 갖는 \\theta_j 를 찾으면 overfitting을 방지한 \\theta값을 찾을 수 있을 것이다.   \\lambda 가 또 너무 커도 Underfitting이 발생할 수도 있음에 주의해야 한다.   \n3.2.3. Regularized Linear Regression\nOverfitting 을 피하기 위해서 Linear Regression 에서 Regularized하는 방법에 대해 알아보자. Regularized 를 Gradient descent 알고리즘에 적용하면 다음과 같다. \\theta_0인 경우는 seperated 되었다는점에 주의 (어차피 1이기 때문이다.)  \n  \n\n분홍색 부분은 J(\\theta)를 편미분한 도함수이다. 증명은 생략한다.   \n\n\\theta_j 항을 모아서 쓰면 다음과 같다.  \n1 - \\alpha {\\lambda \\over m} 항(term)은 흥미로운 영향을 준다.  1 - \\alpha {\\lambda \\over m}  이다. 그리고  \\theta_j 자체를 약간 줄인다. 그 우측 항은 기존 gradient descent 와 동일하다.   \nNormal Equation 은 어떻게 적용할 수있는지 살펴보자. 간단하다 공식은 아래와 같다. L matrix 크기는  (n+1) x (n+1) 이다. (n:feature갯수)\n\\begin{align*}& \\theta = \\left( X^TX + \\lambda \\cdot L \\right)^{-1} X^Ty \\newline& \\text{where}\\ \\ L = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & & & & \\newline & 1 & & & \\newline & & 1 & & \\newline & & & \\ddots & \\newline & & & & 1 \\newline\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}  \n\n3.2.4. Regularized Logistic Regression\nOverfitting 을 피하기 위해서 Logistic Regression 에서  Regularized하는 방법에 대해 알아보자.   \n  \nh_\\theta(x)가 위와 같을때 Decision boundary는 매우 복잡할 것이고 trainig set에는 매우 적합하지만 새로운 데이터에는 과적합(Overfit) 하다. 따라서 Regularized 된 cost function J(\\theta)는 위와 같다. 기존의 J(\\theta)에서 람다 항이 추가되었다. 이것을 가지고 Gradient descent 알고리즘에 적용하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\nh_\\theta(x) 함수의 형태가 linear regression과 다름에 유의.  \n\n"},"documents/ex2.1-logistic-regression.html":{"url":"documents/ex2.1-logistic-regression.html","title":"ex2.1: Logistic Regression","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]);

Neural Networks\n\n4.1. 배경\n\n이미 linear regression, logistic regression이 기계학습에 사용되고 있는데, 신경망 알고리즘은 왜 필요할까?  \nfeature가 늘어날수록 Polynomial 항들은 기하급수적으로 늘어난다. 연산속도나 복잡도등이 매우 높아진다. feature가 늘어날때, 비선형적 요소를 계속 추가하는것은 좋지 않다. \nlogistic regression을 이용해서 자동차인지 아닌지 분류하는 non-linear boundary classification 예를 살펴보자.  \n위,그림과 같이 컴퓨터 비전 문제는 결국 픽셀의 밝기등의 정보에 대한 matrix를 다루는 것이다. 그리고이 이미지에서 우리가 해결할것은 결국 이 matrix를 보고 이 숫자들이 자동차의 손잡이를 나타낸다고 말해줘야한다.   \n다시 자동차로 돌아와서, 두개의 픽셀 위치를 선정해서 색깔을 값을 plotting한다고 해보자. 즉 feature가 2개다. 그렇게 여러종류의 사진을 plot해보면 아래와 같은 형태가 될 것이다.   \n만약 50x50 픽셀 이미지가 있고 모든 픽셀을 feature로 선택한다면 feature갯수가 무려 2500개다. 만에하나 Quadratic feature(x_i \\times x_j)라도 사용한다면 300만개가 넘을 것이다. feature갯수가 증가하면 연산량뿐만 아니라 overfitting의 가능성도 높아진다. 결국 n이 엄청 클때 복잡한 비선형 가설을 학습하는데 단순히 logistic regression을 사용하는것은 적합하지 않다. 복잡한 가설과 복잡한 비선형 가설에서도, n이 클때도 Neural Networks알고리즘을 통하면 이문제를 좀더 쉽게 해결할 수있다. 결론: NN이 필요한이유? Complex Non-Linear Hypothesis를 구하기 위해서!  \n4.2. 지난 내용 remind\n\n\nLogistic regression에서 \\theta^Tx 의 의미는 무엇인가?모든 input feature  x_0, x_1, ..., x_n 에 각각 가중치  \\theta (parameter 또는 weight) 를 고려한 수치. 그렇게 만들어진 \\theta^Tx 는 결국 Decision boundary 경계선을 의미한다.   \n\n4.3. Neuron model: Logistic Unit\n\n  \n뉴런 세포는 input(수상돌기, dendrites)과 output(축삭돌기, axon)이 있으며 이것을 위와 같이 수학적 모델로 나타낼 수 있다.  x_1,x_2,x_3는 input wire로 연결되어있고 가운데 원은 세포라고 볼수 있다. 그리고  h_\\theta(x) 로 향하는것이 output wire이다.  h_\\theta(x) 는 Logistic regression의 가설함수와 마찬가지로, Sigmoid 함수 g(x)의 형태를 띈다. 그리고 feature  x와  \\theta 벡터가 있다.  \\theta는 Weight(가중치)라고 표현한다. 우리가 지금까지 Parameter라고 불렀던것과 동일하다.  x_0는 bias unit이라고 표현하며 항상 1의 값을 가지므로 굳이 나타내지 않아도 된다.이것이 하나의 뉴런을 나타낸 다이어그램이다.   \n\nNN 에서 a_i^j 의 의미는 무엇인가?동일한 feature에 i마다 서로다른 가중치를 곱해 만들어진 Decision boundary 기준으로 어떤 side에 위치해 있는지 0, 1로 (혹은 확률값)으로 결과를 주는 함수 g(z). 위 그림에서 a_1^{(2)} 는 하나의 기준 (\\theta_1^{(1)})을 가지고 정한 하나의 \"분류\"   a_2^{(2)} 도 마찬가지로 또다른 기준을 적용한 분류이다. 모두 동일한 feature에 서로다른 기준(가중치)를 반영해 만들어진것이다. 하나의 logistic regression은 하나의 decision boundary를 가지고 있다. 하나의 logistic regression 의 hypothesis인 a_i^j 는 고유의 decision boundary를 가지고 있는것이고, 결국 NN에서는 층(layer)별로 가지고 있는 desicion boundary들을 기준으로 추상화 시켜서 또다른 desicion boundary 를 생성시키는 것이다. 한마디로 층별로 새로운 desicion boundary 를 생성하는 것과 같다. 그리고 최종 desicion boundary는 최종 class 갯수만큼 나올것.   \n\n4.4. Neural Network\n\n그렇다면 여러개의 뉴런은 어떻게 표현할까?  \n  \nLayer 1은 input layer, Layer3은 output layer라고 부른다. input과 output이 아닌 layer는 Hidden Layer라고 부른다. 위 예제에서는 히든 레이어는 1개이나 두개가 될 수도 있다.    \n이것을 수학적 정의로 나타내보자.   \n  \nHidden Layer의 node를 a_i^{(j)} 라고 표현하고 Activation unit이라고 부른다. 윗첨자 (j)는 layer 번호이고, 아래첨자 i는 feature번호라고 볼수있다. a_i^{(2)} 은 두번째 layer의 activation node이고, a_i^{(3)} 은 세번째 layer의 activation node이다. 각 a_i^{(j)} node가 갖는 \\Theta_{ab}^{(j)}(weight)는 feature 별로(행 별로) 다를 수 있다. 참고로 각 activation node의 값은 sigmoid함수로 계산되기 때문에 0에서 1의 range를 갖는다. \\Theta_{ab}^{(j)} 에서 아래첨자 a,b는 \\Theta^{(j)} matrix의 행과 열을 의미한다. 크기가 a \\times b 인 matrix. 그리고 j번째 layer의 b번째 유닛에서 j+1번째 layer의 a번째 유닛으로 향하는 가중치를 의미한다.  (참고로 윗첨자 아래첨자 기준은 표기 하는 사람 마다 기준이 다른것같다.) \\Theta^{(j)}는 각 feature에 따른 weight가 기록된 matrix이다. 크기를 구하는방법은 아래에서 다시 설명한다. 수학으로 표현하면 \\Theta^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R^{3\\times4}} 참고: \\mathbb{R^n} : refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.    \nLayer1의 x 와  \\Theta^{(1)}를 가지고 layer2의 a_i^{(2)}를 생성하고Layer2의 a_i^{(2)} 와  \\Theta^{(2)}를 가지고 layer3의 a_i^{(3)}를 생성한다....  \n결국 최종적으로  h_\\Theta(x) 는 a_1^{(3)}이 되고  g(\\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \\Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \\Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \\Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)})  으로 계산된다.  h_\\Theta(x) 의 \\Theta는 대문자임에 유의 regression에서의 가설함수와 다르다.  \n이 과정을 간략하게 벡터로 표기하면  \n\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline x_3\\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\newline a_2^{(2)} \\newline a_3^{(2)} \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow h_\\theta(x)  \n  \n아래에서  \\theta matrix의 크기는 몇\\times몇 일까?만약 하나의 네트워크에서 layerj 의 유닛 갯수가 s_j , layerj+1의 유닛 갯수가 s_{j+1}개라면 matrix \\Theta^{(j)}의 크기는 다음과 같이 구할 수 있다.  s_{j+1} \\times (s_j + 1)  따라서, 위의 도식에서 \\Theta^{(1)} 의 크기는 4 \\times 3 이다.  \n4.5. Forward propagation: Vectored Implementation\n\n이것을 Forward propagation 이라고 한다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_2^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_3^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline h_\\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \\Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \\Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \\Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\newline \\end{align*}  \n  \n이것을 수학적으로 더 간단히 표현해보자. g()가 계산하는 항을 간단히 z_i^{(j)}라고 표현해보자.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}a_1^{(2)} = g(z_1^{(2)}) \\newline a_2^{(2)} = g(z_2^{(2)}) \\newline a_3^{(2)} = g(z_3^{(2)}) \\newline \\end{align*}  \n  \n즉 z를 일반화하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \nz_k^{\\color{red}(2)} =   \n\\Theta_{k,0}^{\\color{red}(1)}x_0 +  \n\\Theta_{k,1}^{\\color{red}(1)}x_1 + ... +  \n\\Theta_{k,n}^{\\color{red}(1)}x_n   \n  \n그리고 이것은 많이 보았던 형태로, 다음 벡터의 곱으로 표현될 수 있다!  \n\\begin{align*}x = \\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline\\cdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix} &z^{(j)} = \\begin{bmatrix}z_1^{(j)} \\newline z_2^{(j)} \\newline\\cdots \\newline z_n^{(j)}\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}  \n  \n4.6. Neural Network Learning its Own Features\n\n  \n\n만약 Layer1을 가린다면 계산은 Logistic regression과 동일하다.   \n\n그리고 흥미로운 점은 node a1, a2, a3은 그들 스스로 input node들로부터 학습한 결과라는 점이다.  (And the cool thing about this, is that the features a1, a2, a3, they themselves are learned as functions of the input.) 반면 NN이 Logistic regression보다 뛰어난점은 Logistic regression에서 처럼 Layer 1의 x_1, x_2, x_3 feature에 제약조건을 걸지 않더라도, 새로운 그것만의 feature a_1, a_2, a_3를 만들(학습시킬)수 있다. x_1x_2 같은 polynomial feature를 생성하지 않고도 말이다. 그래서 결국 더 나은 hypothesis 를 사용할 수 있게 된다.   \nLogistic regression에서는 각 feature x_i에 해당하는 가중치  \\theta를 어떻게 정하느냐에 따라서, 그리고 training data들을 더 잘 모사하는 가설함수를 만들기 위해 어떤 polynomial feature를 추가하느냐에 따라서, 예측결과의 정확도가 높아지는데, 그것은 어렵고 연산량만 많아진다. Neural network는 이런 까다로운 작업 필요없이 각 layer단계에서 적절한  \\Theta matrix(가중치)를 선택하여 layer 단계별로 더 유용하게 추상화하여 결국 최종 예측을 더 정확하게 한다는 의미인듯하다.   \n4.7. Examples\n\nOR function\nSigmoid 함수의 결과는 0과 1이 될 수 있다.  NN을 통해 0과 1을 다루는 디지털 논리게이트를 모델링 할 수 있다.   \n  \n\nz = 4.6 이상이면 1에 가깝고,z = -4.6 이하면 0에 가깝다.   \n\n  \n\n가중치(weight)는 화살표에 나타내면 좀 더 직관적이다.   \n\n이것을 수학적으로 표현하면  \n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}g(z^{(2)})\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow h_\\Theta(x)\\end{align*}  \n  \n그리고 아래와 같은 결과가 도출되어 OR에 해당하는 진리표와 결과가 같다.  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\Theta(x) = g(-30 + 20x_1 + 20x_2) \\newline \\newline & x_1 = 0 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 0 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-30) \\approx 0 \\newline & x_1 = 0 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 1 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-10) \\approx 0 \\newline & x_1 = 1 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 0 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-10) \\approx 0 \\newline & x_1 = 1 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 1 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(10) \\approx 1\\end{align*}  \n  \nThe others\n아래와 같은 parameter로 OR 뿐만아니라, AND, NOR도 가능.  \n  \n\\begin{align*}AND:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &=\\begin{bmatrix}-30 & 20 & 20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline NOR:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &= \\begin{bmatrix}10 & -20 & -20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline OR:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &= \\begin{bmatrix}-10 & 20 & 20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline\\end{align*}  \n  \n아래의 모델로 (NOT x_1) AND (NOT x_2)의 형태도 구현이 가능하다.  \n\nXNOR  \n\n두개의 Layer를 두면 더 복잡한 논리게이트 연산도 가능하다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\newline a_2^{(2)} \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a^{(3)}\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow h_\\Theta(x)\\end{align*}  \n  \n\\Theta^{(1)} matrix에서(즉, layer1에서) AND와 OR를 사용하고   \n  \n\\Theta^{(1)} =\\begin{bmatrix}-30 & 20 & 20 \\newline 10 & -20 & -20\\end{bmatrix}  \n  \n\\Theta^{(2)} matrix에서(layer2에서)OR를 사용하면   \n  \n\\Theta^{(2)} =\\begin{bmatrix}10 & -20 & -20\\end{bmatrix}  \n  \n아래와 같은 진리표를 얻을 수 있다!  \n  \nMulticlass Classification\nNN을 통해 하나 이상의 Category로 구분할 수도 있다.  다음은 NN을 이용해 수기로 쓴 번호를 인식한 것이다. 이것도 0부터 9까지 10개의 기호를 분류하는 Multiclass Classification 이다.    \n  \n\nby Yann LeCun  \n\n가운데 보이는 9는 input layer이다. 왼쪽에 보이는 것이 보다 추상화 시킨 Hidden layer 1 그리고 그 다음단계 Hidden layer2, 그 다음단계 Hidden layer3 이된다. 그리고 최종 output은 answer: 9 이다. (이것은 마치 대상에서 점차 의미를 제거하는것과 동일하다. 단계별 추상화의 최종 결과물에는 모든 의미가 사라지고 기호만이 남는다. 이것이 뇌의 근본 동작원리라면, 인간의 결국 뇌는 의미 제거장치인 것이다. 참고: 인포메이션, 제임스 글릭)  \n  \n만약 4개의 사진을 분류한다고 하면, 여러 layer를 거쳐 나온 최종 결과물은 4개의 4 \\times 1 벡터 이다.  \n최종 결과는 y 벡터로 표현가능하다.   \n"},"documents/ex3-1-multi-class-classification.html":{"url":"documents/ex3-1-multi-class-classification.html","title":"ex3.1: Multi-class classification","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\n\nex3-1 Multi-class classification\n\nlrCostFunction.m\nfunction [J, grad] = lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, lambda)  \n...(중략)  \n\nhx = X * theta;  \ngx = sigmoid(hx);  \n\n% Cost function J  \npos = -y' * log(gx);  \nneg = (1 - y)' * log(1 - gx);  \nregular = lambda / (2 * m) * sum(theta(2:end) .^ 2);  \n\nJ = (1 / m) * (pos - neg) + regular;  \n\n% Gradient descent  \n\ngrad = (1/m) * X' * (gx - y) + (lambda/m) .* theta;  \ngrad(1) = (1/m) * X(:,1)' * (gx - y);\n\noneVsAll.m\n\nfunction [all_theta] = oneVsAll(X, y, num_labels, lambda)  \n...(중략)  \n\nfor c = 1:num_labels  \n    initial_theta = zeros(n + 1, 1);  \n\n    % Set options for fminunc  \n    options = optimset('GradObj', 'on', 'MaxIter', 50);  \n\n    % Run fmincg to obtain the optimal theta  \n    % This function will return theta and the cost   \n    [theta] = ...  \n        fmincg (@(t)(lrCostFunction(t, X, (y == c), lambda)), ...  \n            initial_theta, options);  \n\n    all_theta(c,:) = theta';  \nend\n\n\n' 위에서 만든 lrCostFunction 을 가지고 num_labels 갯수만큼 반복한다. fmincg는 최적의 parameter \\Theta를 찾아줄것이고 1x401 크기의 결과(\\Theta)를 줄 것이다. feature가 401개 였기 때문에 그에 상응하는 parameter(weight)의 갯수도 401개. 결과는 단지 all_theta에 반복 횟수만큼 row가 추가되는것. 이 결과 all_theta를 가지고 predict 할것이다.    \n\npredictOneVsAll.m\nfunction p = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)  \n...(중략)  \n\ngx = sigmoid(X * all_theta');  \n[max_pobability_one_example, class_in_one_example] = max(gx, [], 2);  \np = class_in_one_example;\n\nX : 5000 X 401all_theta : 10 X 401gx : 5000 X 10matrix gx의 각 row의 의미: 한 training set의 가설함수 h_\\theta(x) 의 결과가 0~9 순서로 10개 저장되어있다. 해당 training set이  0~9 숫자일확률이 각각 들어있다.max(gx, [], 2); 를 하면 첫번째 결과물은 해당 row의 max 값이고 두번째는 그 max값의 index를 리턴한다. 그게 최종 우리의 예측 값.   \n"},"documents/ex3-2-neural-networks.html":{"url":"documents/ex3-2-neural-networks.html","title":"ex3.2: Neural Networks","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\nex3-2 Neural Networks\n\npredict.m\n\n% Add ones to the X data matrix  \nX = [ones(m, 1) X];  \na2 = sigmoid(X * Theta1');  \n\n% Add ones to the a2 data matrix  \na2 = [ones(m, 1) a2];  \na3 = sigmoid(a2 * Theta2');  \n\n[max_pobability_one_example, class_in_one_example] = max(a3, [], 2);  \np = class_in_one_example;\n\nLayer가 3개인 NN은 Logistic regression을 단계별로 두번 하는것과 동일하다.그렇게 해서 구해진 a3 벡터는  h_\\Theta(x) 벡터이다.X : 5000 x (400+1) (1 열 추가함)Theta1 : 25 x 401a2 : 5000 x (25+1) (1 열 추가함)Theta2 : 10 x 26a3 : 5000 x 10즉 predictOneVsAll.m 경우처럼 한 row의 크기가 10이고 각각에는 0~9 에 해당하는 확률값이 들어있다.     \n"},"documents/5-neural-networks-learning.html":{"url":"documents/5-neural-networks-learning.html","title":"5.

Backpropagation Algorithm\n\n머신러닝은  cost function J()에 대한 미분을 계산해야한다. Backpropagation는 이 미분을 효율적으로 계산하는 방법이다.  늘 그랫듯이, parameter \\theta를 학습하기 위해, cost function J()를 최소화해야 하는데 Backpropagation 이 그것을 위한 방법이다. Input layer에서 출발해서 output을 구하는 forward propagation과는 반대로, BP는 output layer에서 시작한다. 즉, 마지막 결과의 'error'를 먼저 구하고, 해당 error 값을 이용해 각각의 node에서의 error 를 계산한다.(https://wikidocs.net/4262)  \n  \n결국 계산해야할 값은 cost function J()와 J()의 미분도함수(gradient)이다. 이전에 보았듯이 Forword propagation은 아래와 같이 계산된다.   \n  \nBP의 에러값 \\delta는 다음의 그림을 보면 직관적이다. 최종 결과물의 오차는 단순하다. (output - expected) 이다. 이 오차는 누적된것일 것이고, 그 오차들을 이전레이어부터 추적하는것이다. 그렇게 오차를 최소화 하는 방향으로 \\Theta 를 구할 수 있을것.  \n\n(출처 : http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/machine-learning-neural-networks/)  \n\n만약 w(6,2)이 매우 크다면, 매우 큰 output2 가 만들어질 것이고 이것은 매우 큰 Error2를 만든다. 이것은 BP를 할때 큰 비중이 할당될 것이다.   \n어쨋든 BP를 마치면 모든 유닛에 \\delta를 구했다면 cost fuction J()의 Gradient(미분도함수)가 나온다.    \nBack propagation은 다음과 같이 계산한다.  \\delta 는 l 레이어에 있는 node j 에 오류가 있는지를 의미한다. Layer가 4개인 경우, \\delta^{(4)} 는 단순하게 a(4) 에서 label y 를 뺀값이나, 다음 \\delta^{(3)} 부터는 가중치(\\Theta)를 고려해서 계산된다. \\delta^{(l)} = ((\\Theta^{(l)})^{T} \\delta^{(l+1)}) .* g'(z^{(l)})  \n\ng'(z^{(3)}) 은 미분도함수로  g'(z^{(l)}) = a^{(l)}.*(1 - a^{(l)}) 과 같이 계산된다.   \\delta^{(1)} 는 계산하지 않는다.'   \n\n  \n최종적으로 위의 계산을 마치면, 만약 \\lambda = 0 일때, 아래와 같은 결과가 나옴을 증명할 수 있다(고 한다).   \n  \n\\dfrac{\\partial }{\\partial \\Theta_{i,j}^{(l)}}J(\\Theta) = a_j^{(l)}\\delta_i^{(l+1)}  \n  \n이것을 계산하는 BP 알고리즘은 아래와 같다. 이것은결국 cost function J()의 미분도함수를 계산 하는 과정이다.    \n  \n\\Delta 는 a_j^{(l)}\\delta_i^{(l+1)} 를 누적해서 더한것을 의미한다. (그래서 0으로 초기화해서 시작) 순서대로 살펴보면 먼저 Forward propagation 을 하여  a^{(l)} 계산을 마친다.  그 뒤에 back propagation으로  각 \\delta 를 구한다. 그리고 그 두항을 곱해서 \\Delta에 누적해서 더한다. (j = 0) 이 아닐때는 regularization \\lambda 항이 추가됨에 유의 j = 0일때는 bias 항이기 때문에 필요없음.  그렇게 해서 나온 결과를 D_{ij}^{(l)} 라고 표현할 것이다.

Backpropagation Intuition\n\nBackpropagation 의 의미를 좀 더 이해해보자. 먼저 FP의 경우 z_1^{(3)}은 아래와 같이 가중치를 곱한 형태로 계산됨을 이미 살펴보았다. BP또한 방향만 반대 일뿐 매우 유사하다. \\delta 를 방향만 반대로 계산 하는것이다.    \n  \nBP는 아래와 같이 반대로 계산된다. \\delta_2^{(2)}는 layer 3을 향하는 가중치(\\Theta)를 곱해서 계산된다. \\delta_2^{(3)} 도 마찬가지다.  bias unit은 계산되지 않음에 유의  \n  \n5.4. Backpropagation in Practice\n\nOctave에서 실제로 어떻게 사용하는지 알아보자.   \n5.4.1. A. Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters\n결국 NN 에서는 아래의 matrix를 이용하게 된다.  \\theta는 weitght, D 는 cost function J()의 미분 도계수를 의미한다.  \n\\begin{align*} \\Theta^{(1)}, \\Theta^{(2)}, \\Theta^{(3)}, \\dots \\newline D^{(1)}, D^{(2)}, D^{(3)}, \\dots \\end{align*}  \n  \n  \nfminunc() 등을 사용해 optimizing 하기 위해서 아래와 같이 각 matrix를 하나의 벡터로 합친다(unroll)  \nthetaVector = [ Theta1(:); Theta2(:); Theta3(:); ]  \ndeltaVector = [ D1(:); D2(:); D3(:) ]\n\n각 matrix는 아래와 같은 명령으로 다시 분리할 수 있다.   \nTheta1 = reshape(thetaVector(1:110),10,11)  \nTheta2 = reshape(thetaVector(111:220),10,11)  \nTheta3 = reshape(thetaVector(221:231),1,11)\n\n예를들어 3개의 레이어가 있고 각 unit의 갯수가 다음과 같다고 할때 아래와 같이 나타낼 수 있다.   \n  \n결국 이전 챕터에서 살펴 보았던 BP알고리즘을 더욱 간단히 도식화 하면 다음과 같다.fminunc() 의 parameter인 @costFunction이 cost J(\\Theta)와 그의 미분계수 D를 구하는 함수다.   \n  \n5.4.2. Gradient Checking\nBP에 문제가 없는지 확인할 수있는 방법이다. 항상 사용됨.   \n  \n\\Theta가 하나일때 2\\epsilon 만큼 떨어진 두 지점의 기울기를 이용하면 J() 의 미분계수를 추정할 수 있을것이다. 그리고 Octave에서 다음과 같이 implement 된다.   \ngradAppros = (J(theta + EPSILON) - J(theta - EPSILON)) / (2*EPSILON)\n\n멀티 parameter인 경우로 보다 일반화하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n그리고 Octave에서 다음과 같이 implement 된다.   \nepsilon = 1e-4;  \nfor i = 1:n,  \n  thetaPlus = theta;  \n  thetaPlus(i) += epsilon;  \n  thetaMinus = theta;  \n  thetaMinus(i) -= epsilon;  \n  gradApprox(i) = (J(thetaPlus) - J(thetaMinus))/(2*epsilon)  \nend;\n\n그리고 Gradient Checking으로 계산된 gradApprox(i)과 BP로 계산된 미분계수 D벡터가 같은지 확인하면 되는것이다.   \ngradApprox(i) = DVec   \n따라서 Gradient Checking을 사용하는 방법을 정리하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n다시 Training하기 전에 Gradient Checking을 끄지 않으면 엄청 느려질 수 있음에 주의해야한다. Once you have verified once that your backpropagation algorithm is correct, you don`t need to compute gradApprox again. The code to compute gradApprox can be very slow.  \n5.4.3. Random Initialization\n기존처럼 \\Theta 의 초기값을 0으로 정하는것은 NN에서 동작하지 않는다. 그이유는 잘 이해하지 못했음.  따라서 다음과 같이 \\Theta의 초기값을 구한다. 결과적으로 \\Theta 의 범위는 -\\epsilon ~ \\epsilon 이 될 것이다.   \n  \nOctave로 implement 하면:  \nIf the dimensions of Theta1 is 10x11, Theta2 is 10x11 and Theta3 is 1x11.  \n\nTheta1 = rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;  \nTheta2 = rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;  \nTheta3 = rand(1,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;\n\n\nrand(x,y) is just a function in octave that will initialize a matrix of random real numbers between 0 and 1.  \n\n5.4.4. Putting it Together\n지금까지 NN에서 다룬 내용을 모두 종합해보자.   \n첫번째로 적절한 Network architecture를 선택한다. 그것은 다음을 선택하는것이다.    \n\nInput Unit 갯수  \nOutput Unit 갯수  \nlayer 당 hidden unit 갯수 (많을수록 성능 향상, 연산 cost 증가)  \n\nTraining a Neural Network  \n\nRandomly initialize the weights  \nImplement forward propagation to get h_\\Theta(x^{(i)})  \nImplement the cost function  \nImplement backpropagation to compute partial derivatives4번까지 정리하면 이런 모양  \n\nUse gradient checking to confirm that your backpropagation works. Then disable gradient checking.  \n\nUse gradient descent or a built-in optimization function to minimize the cost function with the weights in theta.  \n\n최고점은 h_\\theta(x)^{(i)} 가 실제 값 y^{(i)} 와 가장 차이가 큰 것이고, 최저점은  h_\\theta(x)^{(i)} 가 실제 값 y^{(i)} 에 가장 가깝다는 뜻이다.  gradient descent는 기울기를 하강하는 것이고, BP는 기울기를 하강할때 방향을 설정하는것과 같다.   \n"},"documents/ex4-1-neural-networks.html":{"url":"documents/ex4-1-neural-networks.html","title":"ex4.1: neural networks","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\nex4-1 : neural networks\n\n1. feedforward and cost function (without regularization)\n\nnnCostFunction.m  \n\n\nfunction [J grad] = nnCostFunction(nn_params, ...  \n                                   input_layer_size, ...  \n                                   hidden_layer_size, ...  \n                                   num_labels, ...  \n                                   X, y, lambda)  \n\nTheta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...  \n                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));  \n\nTheta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...  \n                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));  \n\n% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================  \n% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the  \n%               following parts.  \n%  \n% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the  \n%         variable J.

Advice for Applying Machine Learning\n  \n만약 housing price 문제를 ML로 해결한다고 할때, 성능 개선을 위해서 위와같은 전략들을 시도해볼 수 있을것이다. 그러나 이 방법들을 무작정 시도하기보다는 체계적으로 사용하는것이 효율적일 것이다. 6장에서는 다음 두가지로 어떻게 체계적으로 사용할수 있는지 알아본다.   \n\nhow to evaluate learning algorithm  \nML diagnostic  \n\n6.1. Evaluating a Hypothesis\n\n이번챕터에서는 Hypothesis 에대해서 평가하는 방법과, underfitting, overfitting을 피할 수 있는 방법에 대해서 알아본다.   \n70%를 training example, 30% 를 test example로 나눠서 cost function을 계산해본다. Overfitting 인경우는 training error(cost) J(\\Theta) 는 매우 낮고, test error J_{test}(\\Theta) 는 클 것이다.  \n순서는 다음과 같다. (Training/ testing procedure for linear regression) \n\nLearn parameter θ from training data (min. training error J(\\Theta))  \nCompute test set error J_{test}(\\Theta)   \n\nThe test set error:  \n6.2. Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets\n\n  \ntraining example에서 적합한 모델 d=5 를 골랐지만 이게 정말  generalize (다른문제도 정확히 예측)할 수 있는것인지 어떻게 알수 있을까? 따라서 주어진 데이터를 단순히 training/test로만 나눌것이 아니라, d를 fit하기 위한 set역시 만들어야한다.   \n이렇게 3개로 나눈다. 계산은 다음과같이 한다.   \n  \n방법은,   \n\n10 차원 polinormial 모델들에서 각 min J(\\theta)를 통해  \\Theta 를 구한다.   \n해당 \\Theta 를 가지고 먼저  J_{CV}(\\Theta) 를 구해보는것이다.만약 그렇게 계산했더니 4차원 poli모델이 가장 낮은값이 나왔을때, J_{CV}(\\Theta^{(4)})  \n해당 모델을 가지고 J_{test}(\\Theta^{(4)})를 구해본다. 다시 말해 다른 traning set에 계산을 해보는것이다.    \n\n6.3.Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance\n\n\npolinormial 차원수 d에 따라서  \n\nlearning알고리즘을 돌릴때, 원하는대로 동작하지 않는다면 거의 대부분 high Bias문제 또는 high Variance 문제이다. 다시말해 underfitting 문제, 또는 overfitting 문제라는 말이다.   이 것을 어떻게 구분할 수 있는지 알아보자.   \n  \n\nd 는 polinormial degree(차원)을 의미한다.   \n\ntraining examples 내 에서 구한 train error J_{train}(\\Theta) 는 d 가 많아질수록 에러율이 낮아진다. 반면 그럴수록 다른 data set example로 구분해놓은 Cross validation Set (CV) 에서는 해당 모델로는 더욱 맞지 않게 된다. 해당 모델은 training example에서만 정확히 모사되기 때문이다(Overfit). 그래프로 표현하면 위와 같다. 따라서, Underfit(High Bias)일 경우는 Cost(or error) J_{train}(\\Theta)가 값이 크고 J_{CV}(\\Theta) 또한 값이 크다. 그리고 그 둘값이 비슷하다. Overfit(High Variance) 인경우는 J_{train}(\\Theta)이 매우 낮고, J_{CV}(\\Theta) 값이 상대적으로 크다.   \n\nHigh bias (underfitting): both J_{train}(\\Theta)J and J_{CV}(\\Theta)J  will be high. Also, J_{CV}(\\Theta) \\approx J_{train}(\\Theta)   \n\nHigh variance (overfitting): J_{train}(\\Theta)  will be low and J_{CV}(\\Theta) will be much greater than J_{train}(\\Theta)  \n\n\n  \n6.4. Regularization and Bias/Variance\n\n\n\\lambda 크기에 따라서   \n\nLinear regression 의  regularization 하는 경우에 대해서도 알아보자.   \n  \n\n\\lambda 크기에 따라서 bias 가 될 수 있고, variance가 될 수 있다.   \n\n그렇다면 어떻게 적절한 \\lambda를 선택할 수 있을까?  \n  \n\n먼저 \\lambda 는 0부터 0.01 을 제곱해서 늘려가며 12번 try한다. 그렇게  각 min J(\\theta)를 통해  \\Theta 를 구한다.   \n해당 \\Theta 를 가지고 먼저  J_{CV}(\\Theta) 를 구해본다.만약 그렇게 계산했더니 5번째 \\lambda 를 사용한 regularized model이 가장 낮은값이 나왔을때, J_{CV}(\\Theta^{(5)})  \n해당 모델을 가지고 J_{test}(\\Theta^{(5)})를 구해본다.   \n\n(위의 방법과 매우 유사)  \n  \n\\lambda 가 작으면  J(\\theta)도 작아짐에 유의  \n6.5. Learning Curves\n\n\nTraining Example 수 m 에 따라서  \n\n일반적으로 m이 적을때는 J_{train}(\\Theta) 는 training examples를 정확히 모사한다. 극단적으로 m=1,2,3일때 타원의 곡선은 3점을 지나기 때문에 cost가 0이다. 반면 이 모델로 cross validate set 데이터에 적용해봤을때는 오차가 발생한다.   \n\nHigh bias (underfit)  \n\n우측상단 공식처럼 high bias인 hypothesis (직선,linear) 가 있을때, m이 작으면 cv set을 더 정확히 표현할 수 없다. (파란색 그래프) 그리고 m 이 더 늘어난다고 하더라도, 절대적 J_{CV}(\\Theta) 크기는 크게 떨어지지 않는다. 금방 flattened 되어버린다. J_{train}(\\Theta) 은 m이 적을때 무척 낮다가 사이즈가 커질수록 높아지는데 금방 Cross validation error 값에 수렴한다. 이유는 적은 수의 파라미터로  많은 양의 데이터를 표현하기에는 한계가 크기 때문이다. 또한 흥미로운점은, 러닝 알고리즘이 high bias(underfit) 인 경우에는 더 많은 training data를 모아봤자, 별 도움이 안된다는 것이다. 왜냐하면 그래프에서 볼 수 있듯이, m 이늘어나도 J_{CV}(\\Theta)는 크게 작아지지 않기 때문이다. (it`s basically fattened up) 만약 적은수의 feature갯수를 가지고 모델을 만들고 예측할 예정이라면 굳이 많은 양의 training data를 수집할 필요가 없다는 뜻이다. 어차피 오차율이 높기 때문에 모델이 정밀하게 예측하기 힘들기 때문에.   \n\nHigh variance (overfit)  \n\nTraining example에서 많은 수의 feature가 있을때(높은 degree의 polinormial 피쳐등) m의 크기가 커질수록 데이터를 정확히 나타내기는 힘들지만 그래도 크게 틀리지는 않는다. (적어도 training data내에서는) 그래서 J_{train}(\\Theta)는 크게 가파르지 않게 증가한다. 반면, J_{CV}(\\Theta)는 high bias와 마찬가지로 m이 커질수록 낮아진다. overfit인데 m이 커질수록 error값이 더 커지지 않는 이유는 cross validate set 크기도 어느정도 크기 때문에 training set과 크게 차이가 없을 것이기 때문이다. 따러서, m이 작다면 이 둘이 수렴하는 값(gap)의 차이가 큰편이고 m이 커질수록 둘의 차이가 줄어든다.  따라서 High variance인 경우, 다시말해 feature가 많아서 overfitting의 위험이 있는 모델인 경우, training example을 더 많이 모을 수록 저 정확히 예측할수 있다. 질문: feature 를 늘릴때, polinormial feature밖에 추가를 못하는지? 가령 로그함수나, 제곱근함수 등은 사용할 필요가 없나? -> 수치해석에 따르면 모든 미분가능한 함수는 다항식의 합으로 근사할 수 있다(Taylor Series)    \n6.6. Deciding What to Do Next Revisited\n\n지금까지를 정리하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n그리고 마지막으로 NN에 대해서도 알아보자.   \n  \n적은수의 parameter와 layer수는 underfitting 이고 많은 수는 그반대.  \nhidden unit layer갯수에 따라 어떻게 달라질까?  \nModel Complexity Effects:  \n\nLower-order polynomials (low model complexity) have high bias and low variance. In this case, the model fits poorly consistently.  \nHigher-order polynomials (high model complexity) fit the training data extremely well and the test data extremely poorly. These have low bias on the training data, but very high variance.  \nIn reality, we would want to choose a model somewhere in between, that can generalize well but also fits the data reasonably well.  \n\n"},"documents/ex5.html":{"url":"documents/ex5.html","title":"ex5: ","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\nex5\n\nPart 2: Regularized Linear Regression Cost\nfunction [J, grad] = linearRegCostFunction(X, y, theta, lambda)  \n\nH = X * theta;         % X(12x2), theta(2x1)  \nReg = (lambda / (2*m)) * sum(theta(2:end, 1) .^ 2);    % theta(2:end, 1) -> theta(1) 은 더하면 안됨.  \n\nJ = (1/(2*m)) * sum((H - y).^2) + Reg;  \n\nend\n\nPart 3: Regularized Linear Regression Gradient\nGradient 계산 하기   \nfunction [J, grad] = linearRegCostFunction(X, y, theta, lambda)  \n\nH = X * theta;                 % X(12x2), theta(2x1)  \ntheta_0 = [0; theta(2:end, :)];        % H계산 이후에 theta는 2부터 필요함.  \n\nReg = (lambda / (2*m)) * (theta_0' * theta_0);         % theta(2:end, 1) -> theta(1) 은 더하면 안됨.  \n                                                % sum(theta_0 .^ 2) 을 theta_0' * theta_0 으로 표현할 수 있음!  \nJ = (1/(2*m)) * sum((H - y).^2) + Reg;  \n\ngrad    = (1/m) * (X' * (H - y)) + ((lambda / m) * theta_0);  \n\nend\n\nPart 4: Train Linear Regression\nCaller   \n[theta] = trainLinearReg([ones(m, 1) X], y, lambda);\n\nfunction [theta] = trainLinearReg(X, y, lambda)   \n\n\n% Initialize Theta   \ninitial_theta = zeros(size(X, 2), 1);    \n\n% Create \"short hand\" for the cost function to be minimized   \ncostFunction = @(t) linearRegCostFunction(X, y, t, lambda);   \n\n% Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument   \noptions = optimset('MaxIter', 200, 'GradObj', 'on');   \n\n% Minimize using fmincg  \ntheta = fmincg(costFunction, initial_theta, options);\n\nPart 5: Learning Curve for Linear Regression\nLearning algorithm을 디버깅(검증) 하기 위해서 Learning Curve 를 그린다.

Support Vector Machines\n\n지금까지 여러가지 supervised learning 에대해 살펴보았다. 마지막으로 또다른 supervised learning 인 SVM에 대해서 알아본다.   \nLogistic regression와 NN 과 비교했을때, SVM은 복잡한 비선형 함수에 대해서  때때로 더욱 명료하고 강력한 방법이 될 수 있다.   \ndecision boundary 에 큰 gap 을 만듦으로써 더 명확히 classify  할 수 있는것 처럼 보임.Support vector는 desicion boundary 를 support 하는 또 다른 경계를 의미한다. 양 극단의 데이터 포인트를 나타낸 선이다.   \n8.1. Optimization Objective\n\n또 다른 관점의 Logistic regression  \n  \n즉, y=1 일 때 \\theta^Tx를 0보다 엄청 크게 만들어주고, y=0일 때 \\theta^Tx를 0보다 엄청 작게 만들어주는 θ를 찾고 싶은 것이다.  \n  \nSVM 의 cost function은 log를 사용하지 않고 piecewise-linear를 사용한다.cost_1(z) 은 z가 커지면 cost 는 낮아진다. z 가 1 이하가 되면 cost가 커진다.cost_2(z) 은 그 반대.  \n  \ncost function은SVM 에서는 A + \\lambda B 의 형태가 아니라, CA + B 의 형태를 갖는다.새롭게 정의한 cost_1(z) cost_2(z) 를 대입하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n특징은, 1 \\over m 을 사용하지 않는다. \\lambda 대신 C = {1 \\over \\lambda} 를 사용한다.Regularization 이 뒷항이 아니라 앞 항에 있음 주의  \nHypothesis 는 다음과 같다. logistic regression 처럼 0~1 사이의 확률값이 아니라, 0 아니면 1의 값을 갖는다.  \n  \n8.2. Large margin classification\n\n  \nz가 1보다 클 때만 cost_1(z)가 0이 된다. (LR에서는 0이 기준이었음)z가 -1보다 작을 때만 cost_2(z)가 0이 된다.  \n만약 C를 매우 큰 값을 둔다면 어떻게 될까?min cost를 찾을때 첫번째 항이 거의 0이 될 것이다.이렇게 하면 margin이 최대가 되는 decision boundary를 찾을 수 있다.   \n위처럼 보라색, 초록색 으로 경계를 나눌수도 있다. 하지만 검은 선이 최적의 경계선이 될 것이다. suport vector와 decision boundary의 차이인 margin이 최대가 되는 decision boundary가 최적의 경계가 되는것이다.   \n만약 X하나가 좌측 하단에 있을때,C가 엄청 크면 보라색의 boundary를 갖게 될 것이고, C가 크기 않으면 검은색의 boundary를 갖게 될 것이다.   \n  \n그리고 데이터들이 linear하게 구분할수 없는경우도 마찬가지다. C가 크지 않으면 자잘한 데이터들은 무시된다.C가 크면 C가 충분히 크기 때문에 조금 다른 위치에있는 데이터에 대해서도 경계조건을 최대화하는 svm의 원리에 따라 민감하게 반응하여 최대가 되는 위치로 decision boundary가 구해진다.따라서 C의 크기에 따라서 trade-off 관계가 발생한다.   \n8.3. Mathematics Behind Large Margin Classification\n\n위의 내용이 수학적으로 어떻게 이루어지는지 살펴보자.   \n\nVector inner product (내적)  \n\n  \np 는 벡터 v를 벡터 u에 투영한 길이이다. ||u|| 는 벡터 u의 길이이다.아래 두 곱은 서로 동일한 결과를 갖는다. 그리고 결과도 모두 real number이다.아래와 같은경우는 p가 음수가 될 수도 있다.   \n  \n  \n\\begin{matrix}  \nu^Tv &=& p \\cdot ||u|| \\\\  \n     &=& u_1v_1 + u_2v_2   \n\\end{matrix}  \n  \nmin cost function의 두번째 항은 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다. \\theta의 norm의 제곱, 즉 벡터 길이의 제곱이다. ||\\theta||^2 (\\theta_0 은 0이라고 가정한다. )  \n  \n그렇다면 \\theta^Tx^{(i)} 는 어떻게 나타낼까? 다음과 같다. 즉 p^{(i)} \\cdot ||\\theta|| 가 1보다 커야 y=1이다.   \n  \nC 가 크면 결국 min cost는 아래와 같다.   \n  \n\\underset{\\theta} {min} {1 \\over 2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\theta_j^2 = {1 \\over 2} ||\\theta||^2  \n  \n좌측의 예를 보자.  \nDecision boundary가 초록색이라고 할때 \\theta vector는 파란색 수직으로 나타난다.또한 \\theta_0 가 0인것의 의미는  \\theta벡터의 origin이 (0,0)이라는 뜻이다. 0이 아니면 원점을 지나지 않고 다른 위치를 지나게 된다.   \n  \n그렇다면 다음을 보자.x^{(1)} 과  x^{(2)} 이 각각 아래의 데이터를 나타낸다.decision boundary가 초록색일때 \\theta벡터에 투영(projection)시킨 p^{(1)}과 p^{(2)}(음수값)를 구하면 매우 작다. p^{(1)} \\cdot ||\\theta|| \\geq 1 를 만족하려면 ||\\theta||가 매우 커야한다. 반대도 마찬가지.  \n  \n반면, 다음의 우측의 예를 보면 p가 더 크다. 따라서 ||\\theta||가 더 작다.모든 data의 p를 계산했을때 가장 큰값을 선택하면, SVM hypothesis의  margin이 더 커지는 것이다!  \n  \n질문: \\theta 벡터가 왜 decision boundary에 직교(orthogonal) 하는가?그래서  \\theta 는 어떻게 계산된다는것?  \n8.4. Kernel\n\n이번엔 non-linear한 decision boundary의 SVM 에 대해 알아보자.   \n각 polinormial feature들을 f_i 라고 표기한다.이 f_i 를 어떻게구하면, non-linear한 decision boundary 를 구할 수 있을까?  \n  \n만약 임의의 landmark 세개를 선택했을때 (l^{(1)}, l^{(2)}, l^{(3)} ) x로 주어진 데이터를 예측한다고하면,  f는 위와 같이 계산할 수 있다. feature f는 원래 feature가 각 landmark에 얼마나 가까운가를 나타내는것으로 정의한다.   similarity function이 바로 Kernel이다. 구체적으로 여기서는 가우시안 커널을 사용했다(Gaussian kernels)  \n이게 무슨 의미인지 살펴보자.   \n  \n만약 x가 landmark l^{(1)} 과 거의 가까울때, f_1 을 계산하면 1에 가깝다.반면 x가 landmark l^{(1)} 과 매우 멀때, f_1 을 계산하면 0에 가깝다.   \n그리고 임의의 landmark l^{(1)}, l^{(2)}, l^{(3)} 세개는 새로운 new feature x가 될 수 있다.   \nl^{(1)} 이 (3,5) 이고 \\sigma^2 = 1 일때, 이것을 그래프로 그려보면 다음과 같다.x가 (3,5) 일때 는 f_1 이 1이고 멀리떨어질수록 f_1은 0에 가깝다.    \n  \n\\sigma^2 는 가우시안 kernel의 parameter이다. 이 값에 따라 f가 어떻게 변화하는지 보자.\\sigma^2가 작을수록 더 빠르게 0에 가까워질수있다.   \n  \n다음의 예를 한번보자. 만약 training example의 x 하나(보라색)를 선택했을때 \\theta 는 다음과 같이 주어지고 f를 계산햇을때 다음과 같다면, 해당 hypothesis를 계산하면 0.5 이므로 0보다 크다. 따라서 예측하고자 하는 위치 x는 y=1 로 예측할 수 있다.   \n  \n그리고 하늘색 x를 선택해 계산해보면 y=0으로 예측할 수 있다.   \n  \n결국 decision boundary는 l^{(1)} l^{(2)} 에 가까울때 y=1 로 예측가능하고 위의 빨간 선과같다.  \n8.5. Choosing the Landmarks\n\n그렇다면 무슨 기준으로 어떻게 landmark를 선택할수 있을까?한가지 방법은 모든 training set들을 landmark로 선택해보는것이다. (m개)  \n  \n데이터 x가 주어졌을때(여기서 x는 trainig set 또는 CV 또는 test set이 될수 있다)  trainig set과 완벽히 동일하게 선택한 landmark l을 이용해 모든 f 를 계산해본다. 그렇게 f 벡터를 구하면 이것을 x벡터대신 새로운 feature벡터로 사용한다.   \n  \n즉 주어진 x에 대해  \\theta^T f를 계산 했을때,  \\geq 0 이면, y =1 로 예측할 수 있는것이다.  \n그렇다면  \\theta는 어떻게 구하나?다음의 cost function gradient를 이용해 구한다. 기존의 x대신 f 를 사용했음에 유의한다.    \n  \nOverfitting vs underffiting  \n  \nC를 늘리면(\\lambda줄이면) underfit 해결\\sigma^2를 늘리면, overfit 해결  \n8.6. SVMs in Practice\n\n\\theta를 구하기 위해서, 직접 구현 하지말고 잘 구현되어있는 S/W package를 사용해라. 다음의 유명한 라이브러리가 있음.  \n\nliblinear  \nlibsvm  \n\n이들을 사용하기 위해서는 먼저 parameter C를 선택해야하고, 어떤 Kernel(simularity function)을 사용할것인지 선택해야한다.No kernel은 linear kernel을 의미한다. predict y=1, if  \\theta^Tx \\geq 0 .가령, 만약 feature 갯수 n 이 크고, training examples 갯수 m이 작다면 linear kernel을 사용하는게 낫다.   \n만약 Gaussian Kernel을 선택했다면, bias-variance trade-off 관계를 잘 고려해서, \\sigma^2 도 선택해야한다.   \nOctave/matlab 에는 다음과같은 라이브러리를 사용하면 된다.x1에 x^{(i)} , x2에 landmark l^{(i)} 을 전달하면 된다. 때때로 kernel function을 선택해야할 필요도 있음. 그러면 내부적으로 f feature를 계산 해준다.그리고 사전에 feature scailing 도 필요하다.   \n  \nLinear kernel, Gaussian Kernel 말고도 여러가지 Kernel이 있다.   \n  \n이번에는 SVM으로 Multi-class classification을 해보자. 마찬가지로 라이브러리가 잘 나와있다.이전에 배웠던 one vs all 방법처럼 y = i 부터 K번째 까지 반복하며 SVM을 진행하여 여러가지 데이터를 구분할 수 있다.  \n  \n중요 그렇다면 언제 Logistic regression을 사용하고, 언제 SVM 을 사용하면 될까??  \n\nfeature가 많고, training example이 적다면 (n = 10000, m = 10 ~ 1000)-> logistic regression또는 kernel없는 SVM을 사용하는게 유리하다.   \n\nfeature가 적고, training example이 중간정도라면 (n = 1~1000, m = 10 ~ 10000)-> SVM with Gaussian kernel을 사용하는게 좋다.   \n\nfeature가 적고, training example이 많다면 (n = 1~1000, m = 50000+)-> 먼저 feature를 더 만들고,-> logistic regression또는 kernel없는 SVM을 사용하는게 유리하다.   \n\nNN은 위의 모든 경우에 잘 동작할것이다. 그러나 train이 더 느릴 수 있다.   \n\n\n"},"documents/ex6-1-support-vector-machines.html":{"url":"documents/ex6-1-support-vector-machines.html","title":"ex6.1: support vector machines","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\nex6-1. support vector machines\n\n1.

Unsupervised Learning, Dimensionality Reduction\n\n이번 챕터에서는  Unsupervised Learning 에 대해 알아본다. Unsupervised Learning 은 무엇인가? 다음을 보자.  \n먼저 Supervised Learning은 다음과 같이 training sets에 input과 그에 상응하는 label y 이 존재한다.이 label은 정답을 의미한다. 따라서 plot할때 이미 명확히 구분이 된다.   \n  \n반면 Unsupervised Learning 은 training sets 에 label y가 없다. 따라서 주어진 input x들에서 label y 를 발견하는것이 Unsupervised Learning 의 목적이다. 그렇게 label을 발견하는것을 clustering algorithm 이라고 한다.   \n  \n9.1 K-Means Algorithm\n\n그러면 이렇게 clustering 하는 algorithm 중 하나인 K-Means Algorithm 에 대해 알아보자.   \n동작 원리는 다음과 같다.먼저 다음과 같이 주어진 training data가 있다.   \n  \n거기에 random하게 두 점을 찍는다. 그것을 Cluster Centroid 라고 부르며, 우리는 이것을 Iteration을 통해 최종적으로 각 그룹 점들의 중간에 위치시킬 것이다.   \n  \n먼저 모든 training set은 두개의 Cluster Centroid 중 어디에 더 가까운지 나타낼 수 있다. 그렇게 초기 label을 정할 수 있다. 이 예제에서는 색으로 표기함.  \n  \n그 뒤 각 cluster에 해당하는 모든 점들의 평균(Mean)을 구해본다. 그러면 다음과 같이 위치가 약간 바뀌게 될 것이다.   \n  \n그리고 다시 각 training set들이 새롭게 바뀐  Cluster Centroid 중 어디에 더 가까운지 label을 정하면 다음과 같이 바뀔것이다.   \n  \n이제 위의 과정을 다시 반복하면 Cluster Centroid 는 다음과 같이 또 바뀔것이고  \n  \n결국 Cluster Centroid 가 바뀌지 않는 위치로 수렴하게 된다. 이렇게 clustering이 완료된다. 모든 training sets들이 각각 label 을 갖게 되었다.   \n  \nK-Mean 알고리즘의 Input형태는 다음과 같다.K와 training set x^{(i)} 이다.K 를 우리가 직접 선정해야한다.(이것이 K-mean 알고리즘의 최대 단점이기도 하다)  \n  \n위에서 살펴본 K-Mean 알고리즘은 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\nK가 두개라고 가정했을때, 먼저 초기 cluster centroid \\mu_1 \\mu_1 를 정하고 이것을 반복해서 업데이트 할것이다.   \n첫번째 반복문(m회)은 Cluster Assignment Step 이다.모든 training set마다 c^{(i)} 라는 인덱스를 갖는데 일종의 label이다.  각 i번째 training set x^{(i)} 가 어떤 cluster centroid 에 가까운지 표기하는 것이다.  가령 K가 두개일때는 c^{(i)}가 1 또는 2(3또는5 whatever)가 된다.  이것을 대략적으로 다음과같이 계산한다. c^{(i)} = k , min_k||x^{(i)} - \\mu_k||^2 거리가 가장 작은 값의 인덱스이다.   \n\n두번째 반복문(K회)은 Move Centroid Step이다.\\mu_k 를 새롭게 계산하는것이다. 만약 x^{(1)}, x^{(5)}, x^{(6)} ,x^{(10)} 의 c^{(i)}가 모두 2로 cluster되었다고 할때 \\mu_2 를 업데이트하려면 다음과 같이 하면 된다.  \n\\mu_2 = {1 \\over 4} [x^{(1)} + x^{(5)} + x^{(6)} + x^{(10)}] , \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}  \n  \n\n\n  \nK-mean 알고리즘은 명확히 분류하기 어려운 training data도 분류해줄 수 있다. 오른쪽의 경우가 그러한 예인데 옷 사이즈에 대한 분류이다.   \n9.2. Optimization Objective\n\n다른알고리즘과 마찬가지로 K-mean 알고리즘도 최적화 할 수 있다.   \n  \n대문자 K는 분류하는 갯수 전체이고 소문자k는 각 class를 의미한다.\\mu_{c^{(i)}}는 Interation step별로 c^{(i)}로 할당된 x^{(i)} 들의 cluster centroid를 의미한다.결국 K-mean 알고리즘의 목적도 Cost를 최소화하는 c^{(i)}, \\mu_i를 찾는것이다.위의 cost function은 Distortion function 이라고도 불린다.   \n  \n알고리즘에서 첫번째 반복문인 Cluster assignment step에서는 하는일의 수학적 의미는 무엇인가?Centoid \\mu^k 가 고정된 상태에서 변수 (c^1, c^2 .., c^m) 를 이용해 cost J() 를 최소화 하는것과 같다.마찬가지로 두번째 Move centroid step 에서는 Centoid c^i 가 고정된 상태에서 변수 (\\mu_1, \\mu_2 .., \\mu^k) 를 이용해 cost J() 를 최소화 하는것과 같다.    \n9.3. Random Initialization\n\n초기 Cluster centroid를 더 잘 선택할 수 있는 방법을 알아보자.   \n다음 그림처럼 K=2일때 trainig example에서 random하게 두개를 선택한다면,초기에 어떤 Cluster centroid 를 선택하느냐에 따라서 최종 solution이 다를 수 있다.   \n  \n\n(질문) 그런데 두 데이터셋 모두 결국 잘 clustering 될것같이 보임.  \n\n다음 그림처럼 맨위와같이 clustering되면 좋겟지만, 때에따라서 아래 두가지 모양처럼 clustering될 수도 있다. (local optima에 빠짐)  \n  \n해결 방법은 여러 가짓수의 Cluster centroid 모두 선택해서 확인해보는것이다! 그렇게 distortion function J()를 모두 계산해본뒤에 가장 작은 cost를 갖는 Cluster centroid 를 선택하면 된다!그것을 Random initialization 방법이라고 부르고 그 알고리즘은 다음과 같다.     \n  \n참고로 이방법은 K가 적을때 (2~10) 더 효과가 크다.   \n9.4. Choosing the Number of Clusters\n\n위에서도 언급했지만 cluster 갯수 K를 수동으로 정해야한다는 문제가 있다. 그래서 주어진 데이터 집합에서 구하고자 하는 클러스터의 숫자를 설정할 때 여러가지 방법론들이 존재한다.   \n\nRule of thumb가장 간단한 방법은 다음과 같이 정할 수 있다. (데이터 수 m)출처: wikipedia: K-평균_알고리즘  \n\n  \n{\\displaystyle k\\approx {\\sqrt {m/2}}}  \n  \n\nElbow Method클러스터의 수를 순차적으로 늘려가면서 결과를 모니터링 한다. 만약 하나의 클러스터를 추가했을 때 이전보다 훨씬 더 나은 결과를 나타내지 않는다면, 이전의 클러스터의 수를 구하고자 하는 클러스터의 수로 설정한다.  \n\n  \n\nK갯수에 따라 cost J()를 계산해봤을때 왼쪽 그래프 처럼 꺾이는 부분이 있다면 올바른 K 갯수가 될 수있다. (마치 사람 팔의 elbow 모양) 그러나 만약 우측과 같다면 K를 선택하기 모호하다.   \n\n\nK-means for a Later Purpose분류하는 목적에따라 인간의 직관으로 선택하는것이다.   \n\n  \n10. Dimensionality Reduction\nDimensionality Reduction은 Unsupervised Learning의 두번째 type 이다. 말그대로 차원을 줄이는방법.이것으로 Data를 절약할 수 있고, 쉽게 visualizing하여 데이터를 좀 더 직관적으로 이해할 수 있게 해준다.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\n\nPCA는 Dimensionality Reduction 을 하는 가장 알려진 알고리즘 중의 하나이다.   \n위의 예는 2차원 x를 1차원으로 줄이는 것인데, 이때 각 점과 선의 차이인 파란색 선(projection error)의 길이가 최소화 하게 직선을 그리면 된다. (빨간색 라인)반면 분홍색 라인을 그리면 파란색선의 길이가 커지기 때문에 적절하지 않은것이다.  \n위의 그림처럼 2차원에서 1차원으로 줄일때, 최적의 벡터 u^1 을 찾으면 된다. 마찬가지로 만약 3차원 데이터에서 2차원으로 줄인다고 하면 최적의 벡터 u^1 u^2 2개를 찾으면 된다. 이 두 벡터가 평면을 나타낸다.   \n가만보면 PCA는 Linear regression과 매우 유사해 보인다. 하지만 다르다. 그 이유는 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\n왼쪽이 Linear regression, 우측이 PCA인데, PCA는 수직의 projection error 라인을 사용한다. 이것으로 인해 데이터 셋에따라서 전혀 다른 결과를 갖는다. 또한 PCA는 각 feature x 에 해당하는 label y가 없다.   \n\n10.2. PCA, Data pre-processing\n\nPCA를 하기 전에 data preprocessing 을 반드시 해야한다. 다음은 그 방법이다.첫번째는 mean normalization, 두번째는 feature scaling  \n  \n10.3. PCA algorithm\n\n  \n벡터 u^{(i)} 와 새로운 feature z^{(i)} 을 어떻게 구할수 있을까?  \n먼저 n차원에서 k차원으로 줄인다고 해보자. 다음을 계산하면 벡터 U matrix를 구할 수 있다.처음에는 covariance matrix를 계산해야 한다. nxn matrix가 나온다. (\\sum(Sigma) 는 summation이 아니라 matrix임에 주의)그뒤 Octave 에서 [U,S,V] = svf(Sigma); 를 계산하면 벡터 U matrix 를 구할 수 있다. (svd말고 eig 라이브러리도 있음)  \n  \n그래서 우리가 구할수 있는것은 U matrix이다. U의 k 열까지가 우리가 필요한 matrix이다.(n \\times k)  \n  \n그 뒤, feature x n차원 벡터를 z를  k차원 벡터로 로 변환시켜야한다. 다음과 같이 계산할 수 있다. 그러면 z는 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k} 를 만족하는 k \\times 1 크기의 벡터가 나온다. 즉 feature의 크기를 n차원에서 k차원으로 줄인것이다.  \n z = {U_{reduce}}^T x  \n  \n  \nz = \\begin{bmatrix}\\vert & \\vert & & \\vert \\\\ u^{(1)} & u^{(2)} & \\dots & u^{(k)}\\\\ \\vert & \\vert & & \\vert \\end{bmatrix}^T x=\\begin{bmatrix} \\text{---} & (u^{(1)})^T & \\mbox{---}\\\\\\text{---} & (u^{(2)})^T & \\mbox{---}\\\\ & \\vdots & \\\\ \\text{---} & (u^{(k)})^T & \\mbox{---}\\end{bmatrix}x  \n  \n이것을 Vectorized implementation하면 다음과 같이 계산하면 된다.   \nSigma = (1/m) * X' * X;'여기서 X는 (m \\times n) matrix이고, x 는 (n \\times 1) 벡터이다.    \n  \n그리고 U_{reduce} 와 z는 다음과 같이 계산할 수 있다.    \n  \nMini 문제: z 벡터의 j번째 z_j는 어떻게 계산할까?답 ->   z_j = (u^{(j)})^Tx   \n10.4. Reconstruction from Compressed Representation\n\nN 차원 feature x에서 k차원 feature z로 줄이는것을 배웠다. 그렇다면 다시 z에서 N차원 feature x로는 어떻게 돌아갈까? 간단히 다음을 계산하면 된다!. 완벽하게 original로는 돌아갈수 없고, 원래 데이터의 근사값임에 주의해야한다.  우측 처럼 직선에 투영된 x좌표는 얻을 수 있다.   \n  \nX_{approx} = U_{reduce} z  \n  \n만약 {X_{approx}}^{(1)} 를 구하고 싶으면 {X_{approx}}^{(1)} = U_{reduce} z^{(1)}을 계산하면 되고 해당 좌표는 위와같이 투영된 직선 위에 있다.      \n10.5.

Anormaly Detection\n\nAnormaly Detection 은 Unsupervised learning  의 한 방법이다.  그러나 supervised learning 의 측면도 동시에 가지고 있다.   \n(Insight):한마디로 Anormaly Detection은 feature x의 각 data set 값이 평균에서 많이 떨어질수록 비정상으로 예측한다는 방법론이다. 평균에 가까울수록 정상이다. 일반적인 통계 방법과 다른점이라고 한다면, feature x가 여러개가 될 수있다는 점?이다. 정상인지 비정상인지 기준은 모델을 최종 계산한 결과값을 \\epsilon 이라는 threshhold 기준으로 판단한다. 이 값은 수동으로? 선정한다.Anormaly Detection은 언제 사용하는가? 뒤에도 나오겠지만, 수집한 training data가 정상데이터는 많은데 비정상데이터가 그에 비해 월등히 적을때, 이 모델을 이용하면 좋다.    \n다음과 같이 비행기 엔진을 제작할때, 과열과 진동크기 두개의 feature를 가지고 시장에 출하할수 없는 부적격한 제품 인지 판단을 내려보자.   \n  \n확률 p(x)를 구했을때, 높으면 그래프에서 센터에 위치할것이고 합격이다. 반대는 부적합.   \n​        \n만약 data center에서 다음과 같은 feature로 각 컴퓨터를 모니터링 할때, 어느 하나의 컴퓨터가 모델 P(x)  에 해당한다면 그 컴퓨터는 비정상 동작을 한다고 판단할 수 있을것이다.   \n  \n11.1. Gaussian Distribution\n\n가우시안 분포는 정규분포(Normal Distribution)라고도 불린다. Anormaly detection 알고리즘을 개발하기 위해서 먼저 기본적인 정규분포에 대해 알아보자.   \n X ~ N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) 는 x는 \\mu, \\sigma^2 에 해당하는 정규분포를 따른다는 의미다.그리고 p(x;,\\mu, \\sigma^2) 는 다음과 같은 공식으로 계산할 수 있다. 그리고 그 그래프는 다음과같이 정규분포 곡선 모양이 된다.\\sigma^2 은 standard variance 분산 이라고 부르고, \\sigma는 standard deviation 표준 편차 라고 부른다.    \n  \n\\mu 와 \\sigma 에 따른 그래프의 모양은 다음과같다. 곡선의 면적은 1이다.   \n  \n그리고 \\mu 와 \\sigma 는 다음과 같이 계산할 수 있다.   \n  \n11.2. Anormaly detection algorithm\n\n모델 p(x)는 다음과같이 각 feature별 확률 p() 의 곱으로 구한다.  \n알고리즘은 다음과 같다. 다음의 순서대로 계산한뒤 p(x)가 \\epsilon 보다 큰지 작은지 확인하면 된다.   \nj 는 feature 번호다.   \n구한 모델을 가지고 x_{test}^{(1)} x_{test}^{(2)} 의 p(x)를 구해보면 다음과 같고  x_{test}^{(2)} 가 \\epsilon 보다 작기 때문에 문제가 있는 test set이라는것을 알 수 있다.   \n  \n11.3. Developing and Evaluating an Anomaly Detection System\n\n  \ntraining set과 test/ cross validation set은 다음과 같이 구분한다.   \n  \n평가 알고리즘은 다음과 같다.   \n  \ntraining set으로부터 모델 p(x) 를 구한 뒤에 그 모델을 가지고 test set에서도 정상적은 예측을 하는지 확인해본다.정상은 label을 1로 하고 비정상은 label을 0으로 해서 평가하는 것이 마치 supervised learning 과 유사하다.   \n  \n11.4. Anomaly Detection vs. Supervised Learning\n\n지금까지 확인한 문제는 기존의 logistic regression, NN등의 supervised learning 방법으로 해결할 수 있는것으로 보인다.그렇다면 언제 Anomaly Detection 을 사용하고 어떤 경우에 Supervised Learning를 사용하면 좋을까?   \npositive example (y=1) 은 비정상(anomal)을 의미함에 주의한다.   \nAnormaly Detection은 언제 사용하는가? 뒤에도 나오겠지만, 수집한 training data가 정상데이터는 많은데 비정상데이터가 그에 비해 월등히 적을때, 이 모델을 이용하면 좋다.    \nLogistic Reg나 NN같은 supervised learning은 비정상 데이터도 정형화 할 수 있다. 하지만 비정상 값을 전혀 예측할 수 없을때는 anomaly detection을 사용하는게 좋다. 가령 비행기 엔진을 생산할때, 당장 내일 생산된 엔진이 어떤 문제점을 갖게될지 전혀 알수없다면, 그럴때는 평균에서 많이 벗어난 데이터를 비정상(anomal)으로 예측하는 이 모델을 사용하는 것이다.  만약 비행기 엔진이 비정상인경우가 쉽게 예측이 된다면 그때는 supervised learnining을 사용하면 된다.    \n  \nSpam 메일 예측의 경우 수많은 positive example(스팸 메일 데이터들)을 이미 가지고 있기 때문에, Supervised learning을 사용하는 것이다.    \n  \n비정상인 positive example보다 정상 negative example이 월등히 많을때. -> Anomaly Detection 사용.  \n11.5.

Predicting Movie Ratings: Problem define\n\n추천 시스템의 예를 살펴보자.  다음과 같이 영화 평가 데이터가 있다.    \n    \n다음과 같은 4개의 parameter를 만들어 사용한다.   \n\nn_u = 4 유져의 수n_m = 5 영화 갯수r(i,j) 는 사용자 j가 영화 i에 평가를 했는지 여부다. 1또는 0의 값을 갖게 된다.y^{(i,j)} 는 사용자 j가 영화 i에 평가를 매긴 점수이다. 0 ~ 5까지의 값을 가진다. 이 값은 r(i,j) = 1 일때만 정의될 수 있다.      \n\n그리고 초록색 박스는 로맨틱 영화이고 빨간색 박스는 액션 영화라고 했을때, Alice와 Bob은 로맨틱영화에 더 많은 점수를 줬고, 반면 액션영화에는 더 낮은 점수를 매겼다.  Carol, Dave는 그 반대이다.    \n이런경우 위 데이터에서 ?를 예측해 보자는 것이다. 다시말해서 특정 사용자 j 가 특정 영화 i를 어떤 값으로 평가할지 예측하는것이다.    \n직관적으로 생각했을때, Alice와 Bob 은 로맨틱 영화에 더 높은 점수를 매길 가능성이 크고 Carol, Dave는 그 반대일것이다.  Recommander Systems을 이용하면 그 값을 계산(예측)할 수 있다.  이것이 왓챠나 넷플릭스를 사용할때 볼수 있는 평가하지 않은 영화에 대한 내 예상점수인 것이다.   \n이 점수를 예측하기 위해서는 각 사용자가 평가한 데이터에서 어떤 요소를 추출해야할지 생각해보면 다음이 있을 수 있다.    \n\n어떤 장르에 더 많은 평가를 했는지 /높은 점수를 매겼는지, 평가한 영화의 특징(태그), 영화 클릭 횟수, 감독 선호도, 국가 선호도,   \n\n이것이 우리가 정의할 feature x 인 것이다!    \n12.2. Predicting Movie Ratings: Practice\n\n여기서 사용할 방법론은 Content-based recommander system 이다.  이것은 Linear regression을 사용한다.   \n다음의 데이터 셋을 다시 보자.    \n  \n여기서 우리는 feature를 다음과 같이 정의할 수 있다. 영화별로 로맨틱 영화의 정도(degree)를 측정할 수 있을 것이고 그것을 x_1로 기록하였다. 액션영화도 마찬가지로 그 정도를 x_2 로 나타내었다.  하나의 기준(feature x)으로 각 영화의 degree를 나타낸것이다. 이런 feature들이 더 많아질 수 있다. 여기선 두개를 사용했다.    \n그리고 영화 x^{(1)} 에 해당하는 feature vector를 나타내면 다음과 같다. x^{(5)} 도 [1, 0, 0.9] 으로 나타낼수 있을것이다.  여기서 맨처음 값 1은 bias이다.   \n  \nx^{(1)} =   \n\\begin{bmatrix}  \n1 \\\\  \n0.9 \\\\  \n0 \\\\  \n\\end{bmatrix}  \n  \n그렇다면 이제 어떻게 ? 값을 계산할 수 있나? 간단하게 다음과 같이 계산할 수 있다.     \n  \n(\\theta^{(j)})^T x^{(i)}  \n  \n\nWhere,j: 사용자 번호i: 영화 번호 \\theta^{(j)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}n: feature 갯수     \n\n더 구체적인 예를 보자. j가 1인 Alice는 영화 \"Cute puppies of love\"를 몇점으로 평가할 수 있을까?   \n먼저 feature vector x^{(3)} 는 다음과 같다.    \n  \nx^{(3)} =   \n\\begin{bmatrix}  \n1 \\\\  \n0.99 \\\\  \n0 \\\\  \n\\end{bmatrix}  \n  \n만약 어떤 특정 알고리즘을통해 Alice에 대한  \\theta^{(1)} 벡터가 다음과 같이 구해졌다고 가정해 보자.

Collaborative Filtering\n\n실제 영화는 더 복합적인 feature를 가지고 있다. 이번에는 content-based recommander system이 아닌 다른방법에 대해 알아보자.    \nCollaborative Filtering 은 어떤 feature가 필요한지 스스로 학습하는 Feature learning 이다.   \n다시말해 영화가 로맨틱한 정도와 액션인 정도의 값을 어떻게 구할 수 있는지이다. 이 값을 학습한다.    \n다음의 training data를 다시한번 보자. 해당 영화가 얼마나 로맨틱한지 얼마나 액션스러운지 일반적으로 정하는것이 쉽지 않다. 그래서 이것을 학습시켜보는 것이다.   \n  \n먼저 위의 4개의 \\theta 와 같이 각 사용자가 얼마나 로맨틱영화를 좋아하는지, 얼마나 액션영화를 좋아하는지 우리에게 알려주었다고 가정해보자.다시말해서 각 사용자 j 스스로가 본인의 \\theta^{(j)}를 정하는것이다.  우리가 이 정보만 얻을 수 있다면, 우리는 역으로 feature x_1 x_2 를 추론할 수 있게 된다.    \n첫번째 영화에 대한 x^{(1)} feature 벡터는 어떻게 계산할 수 있나? 먼저 Alice의 \\theta^{(1)} 을 이용해 계산해보자. 그러면 다음과 같은 관계를 얻을 수 있을 것이다.   \n(\\theta^{(1)})^T x^{(1)} = 5 즉 Alice는 영화 x^{(1)} 을 5점을 줄것이라는 것이다. 이런식으로 첫번째 영화x^{(1)} 에 대해서 우리가 얻은 각 사용자의 \\theta^{(j)} 를 모두 계산해보면 다음과 같게 된다.   \n  \n(\\theta^{(1)})^T x^{(1)} \\approx 5 \\\\  \n(\\theta^{(2)})^T x^{(1)} \\approx 5 \\\\  \n(\\theta^{(3)})^T x^{(1)} \\approx 0 \\\\  \n(\\theta^{(4)})^T x^{(1)} \\approx 0 \\\\  \n  \n\nMINI Quize:다음을 계산해보자. 답은 0.5가 된다. \\theta * ? 는 User가 매긴 점수가 되어야 하기 때문이다.  \n\n종합해보면, feature x 의 값을 다음과 같이 구할 수 있다.공식은 기존의 cost function과 동일하고 지난번에는 x를 알고 \\theta 를 구하는 것이었다면, 이번에는 \\theta 가 주어졌을때, x를 얻는 cost function인 것이다.   \n  \n그리고 실제로는 직전에 \\theta 를 구할때 처럼 주어진 모든 User의 \\theta를 통해 모든 feature x^{(i)} (1 ~ n_m개) 를 계산해야하기 때문에 최종 공식은 다음과 같게 된다.    \n  \n그리고 최종 x 는 gradient descent 알고리즘을 이용해 구한다.   \n이전 계산과 비교해보면 이렇다. 결국 x가 주어졌을때 \\theta 구할거냐 \\theta가 주어졌을때 x 구할거냐의 문제다.   \n  \n이 둘을 조합해서 사용하면 더 정밀한 결과를 얻을 수 있을것이다. 그것이 Collaborative Filtering 알고리즘이다.    \n어떤 방식으로 조합할 수 있을까?  \nInitial random \\theta -> x -> \\theta -> x -> \\theta -> x ...  \n먼저 random 하게 \\theta 를 구해본 뒤 이것을 가지고 x 를 구한다. 그뒤 그 x 를 가지고 다시 조금 더 정확한 \\theta 를 구한다. 또다시 그 \\theta 를 가지고 보다 더 정확한 x 를 구해본다. 이것을 반복하다보면 결국 매우 훌륭한 x 와 \\theta 를 얻을 수 있다.  \n12.4. In practice of Collaborative Filtering\n\n  \n실제로는 Random \\theta -> x -> \\theta -> x -> \\theta -> x ... 처럼 순서대로 구할 필요는 없다. 이 둘을 동시에 진행하는것이 가능하다. 다음과 같이 새로운 cost function J()을 정의함으로써 구현이 가능하다.   \n위의 두 공식을 더한것과 동일하다. \\sum 의 (i,j):r(i,j)=1 은 위의 두공식의 각각의 것을 더한것과 동일한 의미를 갖는다.   \n  \n결국 J() 를 최소화 하는 parameter x \\theta 를 구하면 되는것이다.   \n  \n알고리즘은 다음과 같다.    \n  \nGradient descent 는 cost function J(x, .., \\theta, ..) 에 대해서 x^{(i)} 와 \\theta^{(j)}에 대해서 각각 편미분한 것을 이용한다.    \n12.5. Low Rank Matrix Factorization\n\n벡터화 된 Collaborative Filtering 알고리즘에 대해 알아본다.    \n먼저 유져의 영화 평가 정보는 다음과 같이 Y matrix로 표현 가능하다.    \n  \n그리고 Y의 예측값인 Predicted ratings는 우측과 같이 계산될 수 있다.    \n  \n그리고 matrix X 와 \\Theta 를 다음과 같이 정의해보자.   \n  \n그렇다면 Predicted ratings, Y 의 예측값은 다음과 같이 계산 될 수 있다.   \n  \nX\\Theta^T  \n  \n이렇게 벡터화한것을이것을 Low Rank Matrix Factorization 라고 부른다.    \n12.6. Finding related movies\n\n그렇다면, movies i와 유사한 영화들 j 는 어떻게 구할 수 있을까?    \n영화 i의 feature x^{(i)} 가 영화 j 의 feature x^{(j)} 가 유사하다면, 즉 차이가 작다면, 관련도가 매우 높은 영화라고 할 수 있지 않겠는가?  이를 수학적으로 표현하면  \n  \nsmall || x^{(i)} - x^{(j)} ||   \n  \n따라서 만약 영화 i 와 유사도가 높은 5개의 영화를 찾고자 한다면 ||x^{(i)} - x^{(j)}|| 가 가장 작은 영화 j 를 5개 선정하면 되는것이다.     \n  \n12.7. Implementational Detail: Mean Normalization\n\nMean Normalization 을 사용하면 종종 더 잘 동작할 수 있다. 만약 어떠한 영화도 평가하지 않은 사용자가 있다고 해보자.    \n  \n이 사용자에 대해서 Collaborative Filtering 을 이용하면 어떤 값을 예측해주는지 살펴보자.    \n\\theta^{(5)}에대해서 영향이 있는 유일한 항은 마지막항이다. 따라서 cost function J() 를 최소화 할때, 사용자 5 번에 대해서는 {\\lambda \\over 2} [(\\theta^{(5)}_1)^2 + (\\theta^{(5)}_2)^2] 을 계산하면된다.결국 \\theta^{(5)} 는 [0; 0] 이 된다. 따라서 \\theta^{(5)} 에 대해서 모든 x^{(i)}를 계산하면 다음과 같이 0이 될것이다.  \n  \n(\\theta^{(5)})^T x^{(i)} = 0  \n   \n따라서 사용자5 Eve는 모든영화에 대해서 0으로 예상점수를 줄 수 있을것이다.    \n이 방법은 매우 Useless 해보인다. 다른방법을 살펴보자.바로 다른 사용자가 평가한 값을 평균내는것이다. 이것이 Mean Normalization 방법이다.    \n다음과 같이 평균은 \\mu 벡터로 표현해보자. 그리고 Y에서  \\mu 를 뺀다. 이것은 평균을 0으로 normalize한것이다. 이렇게하면 평균이 0이 된다.   \n  \n이렇게 변경한 Y matrix를 가지고 parameter \\theta^{(5)} 와  x^{(i)} 를 학습할 것이다.   \n따라서 영화 i에 대해서 사용자 j의 예측값은 다음과 같이 될 것이다. \\mu 를 다시 더해서 original 로 돌아간다.   \n  \n사용자 5에 대해서 이것을 계산해보면 \\mu_i 만 남는다. 즉 아무것도 평가하지 않은 사용자에 대해서 영화  x^{(i)} 를 평균값으로 예측해준다는 의미다.    \n"},"documents/ex8-recommander-system.html":{"url":"documents/ex8-recommander-system.html","title":"ex8: Recommander System","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\n\nex8: Recommander System\n\n\nex8_cofi.m  \n\nfunction [J, grad] = cofiCostFunc(params, Y, R, num_users, num_movies, ...  \n                                  num_features, lambda)  \n\n% 1.

With the amount data that many websites/companies are gathering today, knowing how to handle ‘big data’ is one of the most sought after skills in Silicon Valley.  \n13.1 Learning With Large Datasets\n\n왜 Large Datasets 이 중요할까? 가장 좋은 성능을 내는 알고리즘은 low-bais 즉 많은 수의 training data가 있어서 underfit하지 않는것이다.    \n그러나 Large Datasets 을통해 학습하는것은 그만의 문제를 가지고 있다.  computational problem 을 가진다.   \nGradient descent 는 다음과 같이 구한다. 만약 training example 갯수 m이 100,000,000개라고 하자. 단하나의 기울기를 구하는데 100,000,000번의 덧셈을 계산해야한다.    \n  \n이번 장에서는 이러한 문제를 해결하는 또 다른 방법에 대해서 알아볼것이다.   \n만약 m 을 1000개만 선택한다면 어떨까?위의 learning curve를 보자. 우측은 high bias이다. . learning curve를 그렸을때, 우측과 같다면, 좌측의 형태로 변경하면 된다.m을 적게 선택해도 좌측과 같은 curve가 나오면 괜찮다?    \n\"우선은 이렇게 많은 데이터가 과연 꼭 필요한지를 확인하는 것이 좋다. 가령, 임의로 뽑은 m=1,000 subset만으로 충분히 학습이 가능하다면 굳이 그 모든 데이터를 사용하지 않아도 된다. 이는 learning curve 를 그려봄으로써 확인할 수 있다. 데이터를 더 넣어주어도 더이상 성능 개선이 없는 high bias 형태라면 적당량 이상의 데이터를 넣어줄 필요가 없다.\" (text 출처: https://wikidocs.net/7178)  \n13.2. Stochastic Gradient Descent\n\nlarge training set에서의 gradient descent의 문제는 computational cost가 엄청나게 크다는 것이다.이것을 해결하기 위한 Stochastic Gradient Descent에 대해서 알아보자.    \n우리는 Linear regression에서 다음을 살펴보았다. 여기서 박스부분이 연산 비용이 상당히 크다는것을 알수있다. 고작 한 step 만 하상하는데도 말이다.    \n  \nStochastic Gradient Descent의 cost function은 다음과 같다. 전체 training example m을 모두 더하는것이 아니라 i 번째 example이 얼마나 맞는지만 확인하는 것이다.  즉 i 에 대한 h_\\theta{(x^{(i)})}_ y^{(i)} 의 차이를 구해보는것이다.    \n_  \n다시말하면, 300,000,000 개를 전부 오랫동안 계산해서 하나의 single step을 구하지말고, 그 중간에 작은(더 부정확할수 있는) step을 하나 계산해보자는 것이다.   \n알고리즘은 다음과 같다.   \n  \n먼저 dataset을 섞는다.그 뒤에 하나의 example에 대한 한 step \\theta 를  계산한다. 이것을 반복하면서 \\theta 를 개선한다.그러니까 기존방법처럼 하나의 step을 계산하기 위해서 모든 m을 다 계산 해보는것이 아니라, single example만 계산한뒤 m번 반복해보는것이다.   \n  \n보통 global minimum을 향해 가지만 항상 그곳에 수렴하는것은 아니다. Batch gradient descent처럼 한곳에 수렴하지 않는다.global minumum 주의를 돌것이다. 따라서 global minumum 에서 가까운곳을 돌고있다면 꽤 좋은 hypothesis 를 얻었다고 볼 수 있다.    \nRepeat {} 은 몇회정도 반복하는게 좋을까 1~10회정도 반복한다.    \n따라서 더 빠르다!  \nBatch gredient descent는 하나의 step을 하강하는데 m 을 모두 계산하는 반면,  Stochastic Gradient Descent는 정확도는 떨어질 지라도 빠르게 하강할 수 있다.    \n13.3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent\n\nMini-Batch Gradient Descent 는 종종 Stochastic Gradient Descent 보다 더 빠를 수 있다.Mini-Batch Gradient Descent 는 Batch Gradient Descent 와 Stochastic 의 중간즘이라고 보면 된다.    \n이 세가지를 비교해보면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\nb 는 mini-batch size로 1 과 m 의 사잇값이다.  보통 2~100 사이이다.    \n\n알고리즘은 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\nb=10이면 gradient는 10개의 example을 누적하여 더해서 계산한다. (stochastic 은 1개, batch는 1000개)300,000,000 번을 더하여 하나의 step을 얻는것보다는 훨씬 빠른것이다.   \n\n적절한 b값과 좋은 vectorized implementation 을 하면 좋은 성능을 낼 수 있다.   \n13.4. Stochastic Gradient Descent Convergence\n\n다음 두가지를 알아보자.   \n\n어떻게 gradient descent가 수렴하는지 확신할수 있는가?   \n어떻게 learning rate \\alpha 를 구할 수 있나?  \n\nStochastic Gradient Descent를 하는 중간에 \\theta 를 update 하기 전에 hypothesis가 잘 동작하고 있는건지 cost를 계산해서 확인해보면 어떨까?   \n  \n1000 번의 반복마다, cost(i) 함수를 plot해보는것이다.  m 전체를 계산하는 J()와는 다르다.    \n다음과 같이 plot 해 보았을때,  \n  \n\n너무 noisy 하게 plot되면 example 수를 늘려라  \ncost가 증가하면 \\alpha 를 줄여야한다.   \n\n13.5. Advanced Topics: Online Learning\n\n지금까지는 이미 수집한 training example을 기반으로 ML을 했다. 학습을 했다. 만약, training example이 계속해서 수집된다면?  수많은 training data가 막대하게 들어올때는 어떻게 하면 좋을까?  \nWith a continuous stream of users to a website, we can run an endless loop that gets (x,y), where we collect some user actions for the features in x to predict some behavior y.  \nYou can update θ for each individual (x,y) pair as you collect them. This way, you can adapt to new pools of users, since you are continuously updating theta.  \n예를 들어, 한 택배 회사 웹사이트에서 출발지와 배송지를 입력하면 배송비 견적을 제시해준다고 하자. 사용자들은 해당 택배 서비스를 이용하기로 결정할 수도 있고 (y=1) 아닐 수도 있다 (y=2).  \nFeature x는 사용자 정보, 출발지, 배송지, 그리고 견적가 등이 될 수 있다.  \n  \nlogistic regression을 사용해 online learning을 하면 다음과같이 구할수 있다.   \n  \n일반적인 logistic regression과 다른 점이라면 하나의 example마다 θ를 업데이트하고 한 번 사용한 example은 버린다는 점이다.  \n이 방법을 사용하면 변화하는 사용자 성향에 맞춰 최적화할 수 있다.  \nIn the approach to online learning discussed in the lecture video, we repeatedly get a single training example, take one step of stochastic gradient descent using that example, and then move on to the next example.  \n다른 예를 보자.만약 유져가 다음과 같이 검색을 했을때, \"Android phone 1080p camera\" 그에 해당하는 10개의 결과물을 return 해야한다면 어떻게 해야할까?   \n  \n  \n13.6. Advanced Topics: Map Reduce and Data Parallelism\n\n지금까지는 하나의 컴퓨터에서 하나의 ML알고리즘을 사용했다. 이번에는 여러개의 ML알고리즘을 동시에 사용하는 방법에 대해서 알아볼 것이다.   \ntraining examples 을 4개로 나눠서 4개의 PC 에서 1개의 알고리즘으로 학습시킨다.  4배 빠른속도로 학습할 수 있다.    \n  \n일반적으로는 다음과 같다.   \n  \n하나의 컴퓨터에서 멀티코어를 가지고 나눌수도 있다.    \n  \n"},"documents/14-application-example-photo-ocr.html":{"url":"documents/14-application-example-photo-ocr.html","title":"14.

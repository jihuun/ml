Introduction\n\n1.1.1. 응용분야\n\n빅 데이터 분석    \n사람이 일일이 프로그래밍할수 없는 분야무인vehicle, 자연어처리, 손글시인식, 영상처리    \nSelf-customizing programs    \nunderstanding human learning    \n\n1.1.2. ML 두가지 정의\n\n컴퓨터에게 특정한 프로그래밍 없이도 스스로 학습할 수 있게 만들어주는 연구\"Machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.\"     \n\n작업 T가있고, P로 성능이 측정될때, 그 P가 경험E를 통해 학습하며 향상되는 프로그램.om Mitchell provides a more modern definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"    \n\n\nExample: playing checkers.    \nE = the experience of playing many games of checkersT = the task of playing checkers.P = the probability that the program will win the next game.    \n1.1.3. ML 알고리즘 종류\n\nSupervided learning: 컴퓨터에게 무엇을 어떻게 하는지 알려줌    \nUnsupervided learning: 그 반대    \nOthers  Reinforcement Learning  Recommender systems    \n\n이 강좌는  Supervided learning, Unsupervided learning 두가지에대해 중점적으로 배운다.     \n1.1.4. Supervised Learning (지도 학습)\ndata set이 이미 있고 우리는 그 데이터에 대한 답을 이미 알고있을때, 그런 상태에서 컴퓨터를 학습시키는 방법우리가 알고리즘에게 정확한 답을 알고있는 data set을 준다.data set의 형태는 [data, label] 이다. 즉 [데이터, 그에 상응하는 답]따라서 예측하는 대상은 label이 아직 정해지지 않은 data set인 것이다.      \n사례: 손글씨 숫자(http://solarisailab.com/archives/1785)    \n이때 예측하는 결과값이 연속인지/이산적인지에 따라 다음 처럼 두가지로 분류된다.      \n\nRegression problem: 연속적인 결과값을 예측  다음 3달동안 얼마나 많은 제품이 팔릴지 예측하는것    \nClassification problem: 이산적인 결과값을 예측  각 계정이 해킹을 당했는지/아닌지 판단하기    \n\n예시1) 부동산 팔 집값 예측    \n\nClassification 문제    \n\n이산적인 결과값을 예측하는 문제예시2) 종양 크기에 따라서 양성/음성 예측.    \n먼저 단순히 종양의 크기에 따라 분류할 수 있다.두번째로 아래 그래프 처럼 크기에 나이라는 속성(feature)도 같이 고려하여 분류할 수 있다.그것 뿐만아니라 더많은 속성을 고려할 수 있다. Clump 두께, 종양 세포크기의 균일함, 모양의 균일함 등등..Learning 알고리즘은 이런 속성이 두 세개를 넘어서 무한이 많아질 수 있다.     \n\n질문: 그렇게 되면 그래프의 축이 무한히 많아지는것이다. 그 무한히 많은 축(차원)에서 아래 linear한 직선같이 구분지을 수 있는 함수를 찾는것이 중요한것 같다. 그것이 예측 모델을 찾는것?    \n\n    \n1.1.5. Unsupervised Learning (비지도 학습)\n반면 비지도학습은 데이터에 대한 label(정답)이 주어지지 않은 상태에서 컴퓨터를 학습시키는 방법이다.즉 [data] 의 형태로 학습을 진행한다. 따라서 주로 데이터에 숨겨진 특징이나 구조를 발견하는데 사용된다.     \n\nClustering 알고리즘: 주어진 data들을 clustering함    \nNon-Clustering 알고리즘: 칵테일 파티장 녹음데이터에서 특정음성만 분리해냄.    \n\n사례:수많은 뉴스를 자동으로 clustering해서 분류하는 알고리즘특정 유전자로 개체별 특성 분류천문학소셜 네트워크    \n    \n\n각 o가 어떤걸 의미하는지는 모르나, 두개의 그룹으로 분류되는것처럼 보임    \n\n    \n\n비슷한 종류의 유전자끼리 분류가 됨    \n\n1.1.6. 참고: Reinforcement Learning\n강화학습은 에이전트가 주어진 환경(state)에 대해 어떤 행동(action)을 취하고 이로부터 어떤 보상(reward)을 얻으면서 학습을 진행한다. 이때, 에이전트는 보상(reward)을 최대화(maximize)하도록 학습이 진행된다    \n"},"documents/1.2-linear-regression-with-one-variable.html":{"url":"documents/1.2-linear-regression-with-one-variable.html","title":"1.2. Linear Regression with One Variable","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n1.2. Linear Regression with One Variable\n\n1.2.1. Model and Cost Function\n\n이번장에서는 Linear regression 알고리즘에 대해 알아보고 Model에 대해서 그리고 지도학습의 전체 과정에 대해서 알아볼 것이다.Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.    \n1.2.2 Linear Regression\n그림과 같은 데이터가 있을때, 1250 사이즈의 집이 있다고 치면, 얼마의 값으로 팔면 좋을지 예측하는 문제가 있다고 하자. 가장 먼저 해볼 수 있는것은 Model을 만드는 것이다. 가장 간단한 모델은 그림의 분홍색 그래프처럼 linear 한 선을 그어보는 것이다.이것이 Supervised learning의 한 예시이다. 그이유는 이 문제에서 나의 문제(팔 가격 예측)에 적합한 답을 주기 때문이다.     \n    \n이것은 traning set이라고 하는 data set이다. 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 이 데이터로부터 어떻게 주택 가격을 예측할지 학습시키는 것이다.     \n    \n다음의 notation을 사용한다.     \nm: 학습 데이터 갯수x: input값, featurey: output, target    \n위의 그림에서 x_1 = 2104,  x_2 = 1416, y_1 = 406 이다.    \n1.2.3. Model Representation\nHypothesis Function (가설 함수)    \n    \n\ntraining set 데이터를 학습 알고리즘을 거치면 함수가 나오는데 그것을 h라고 표기한다. Hypothesis Function 이라고 부른다.    \n\nHypothesis Function은 다음과 같이 수식으로 나타낼 수 있다.     \n  \nh_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x    \n  \n1.2.4. Cost Function (비용함수)\nCost Function으로 Hypothesis Function의 정확도를 평가할 수 있다.h(x) 함수는 아래와같이 표현된다.\\theta_0 \\theta_1 을 어떻게 선택하느냐에 따라 h(x)는 아래 그림과 같다.결국 목적은 주어진 training set을 가지고, a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y 하도록 학습하는 것이다.     \n    \n결국 세타0 세타1 을 적절하게 선택하여 h(x) - y (예측값 - 실제값)의 차이가 최소화가 되도록하면 된다.그것을 찾는 방법을 공식화하면 다음과 같다. 이것이 Cost Function이다.J()로 표현되는 이 Cost Function은 오차함수의 제곱이라도고 불린다. 이 제곱함수는 회귀분석에서 가장 많이 사용된다. (제곱을 하는 이유는 음수, 또는 미분을 해야하기 때문으로 생각됨)     \n    \n\ntraining set에서 각 (예측값i - 실제값i)을 제곱하고 합을구한뒤 평균을 낸다.      \n\n    \n결국 목적은 Cost Function을 최소화 하는것이다. Cost Function이 작아질 수록 Hypothesis Function의 정확도는 향상된다.    \n  \nh_\\theta(x) 정확도 \\propto {1 \\over J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)}    \n  \n1.2.5. Simplified Cost function of Linear Regression\n가설/비용함수 개념을 더 잘 이해하기 위해서 우리는 \\theta_0 를 0으로 만든 단순화 버전을 사용할 것이다.  단순화 시킨 h_\\theta(x) 의 그래프는 원점을 지난다.정리하면 다음과 같다.     \n\n\n\n\nbasic\nsimplified\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x \n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_1 \n\n\nParametears:\n \\theta_0 , \\theta_1 \n \\theta_1 \n\n\nCost Function:\n J(\\theta_0 , \\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \n J(\\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \n\n\nGoal:\n \\underset{\\theta_0 , \\theta_1}{minimize} \\ J(\\theta_0 , \\theta_1) \n \\underset{\\theta_1}{minimize} \\ J(\\theta_1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n가설함수  h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_1 \n비용함수   J(\\theta_1) \n\n\n\n\ninput값 x 에 대한 함수\nparameter \\theta 에 대한 함수 (직선의 기울기를 좌우함)\n\n\n\n다음과 같은 Training Data가 주어졌다고 하자.     \n    \n\n먼저 실제 데이터(Training data) X가 x-y평면에 흩뿌려져 있다.(그림과 다르게 더 불규칙할 수 있음) 우리 목적은 최대한 그 데이터를 잘 모사 할 수 있는 직선h_\\theta(x)을 찾는것이다.     \n\n이제 \\theta_1의 값에 따른 가설함수와 cost 함수의 관계가 어떻게 변화하는지 살펴보자.     \na. \\theta_1 = 1 일때\n결론적으로 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 은 실제 데이터(Training data)와 정확히 일치하게 되고, 이 예시 데이터에서  J(1) 은  0으로 우리의 목적인 최소값이 된다.(예측값 - 실제값)이 0이 된다.     \n    \n\n그래프 설명: 왼쪽의 plot X는 \"실제 값\"(Training data)이다. 거기에 \"예측 값\"인 h_\\theta(x) 을 그렸다.우측: \\theta_1 = 1 일때  J(\\theta_1)  값은 0이 된다.   J(1) = 0  이다.그리고 h_\\theta(x) = x 가 된다. 실제 데이터도 y=x 를 따라 위치해있으므로 두 데이터가 정확히 일치한다.가령 집 크기가 2일때 예측한 짒값은 2인데 실제 집값도 2이다. 라는 의미    \n\n실제 데이터가 y=x 를 따라 무한히 주어지지는 않을 테지만, 비용함수 계산 결과 0으로 나오므로 여기서 우리가 선택한 직선인 h_\\theta(x) 는 실세계를 정확히 거의 예측할 수 있는 것이다. 결국 Linear Regression은 실제 이미 알고있는 유한한 데이터를 기반으로 모르는 값을 예측/추측 할때 사용한다.     \n    \n\n질문: (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 에서 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 의 결과는 예측값이고 y^{(i)}는 실제 값이다. 그런데 아래 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 그래프에서 y축은 예측값이지 실제 값이 아니지 않은가?     \n그래프에서 y 축은 실제값을 나타내는게 맞다. h_\\theta(x^{(i)})가 찍는 그래프는 y에 대한 예측값을 찍는것이다. 반면 X로 표기된 값이 실제 값이다.  여기서 설명하는 linear regression은 supervised learning이기 때문에 주어진 training set(data set)의 y값 즉 정답을 이미 다 알고있다는 가정하에 한다. 따라서 (예측값-실제값)이 맞다.\\theta_1가 1일때는 예측 모델(?) 예측값이 실제값과 동일해진다는것을 설명한 것이다.따라서 실제 training set과 h 그래프는 위와 같이 표현되는게 더 정확하다.위 연습문제를 계산해보면 결과는 아래와 같음    \n  \n> \\begin{matrix}    \n> J(0) &=& {1 \\over 2 \\times 3} \\times ((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 +(0 - 3)^2) \\\\    \n>    &=& {14 \\over 6}     \n> \\end{matrix}    \n>   \n\nb. \\theta_1 = 0.5 일때\n    \n\n가령 집 크기(x)가 2일때 예측한 짒값(y)은 1이었는데, 실제 집값은 2었다는 의미    \n\nc. \\theta_1 = 0 그리고  \\theta_1 = n일때\n    \n1.2.6. Cost function of Linear Regression\n이제 \\theta_0 를 사용한 실제 Cost function 을 살펴보자\\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 이 모두 존재하기 때문에 Cost function  J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  는 그림과 같이 3차원 그래프가 될 것이다.    \n3차원 그래프는 아래 우측과 같이 보기편하게 Countour plot(등고선 그래프)으로 변경해서 사용할것이다. 위에서 내려다 본 모습과 일치하고 같은 등고선은 같은 높이의  J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) 를 의미한다.    \n우측 그래프의 빨간점 x 는 \\theta_0 = 800  \\theta_1 = -1.5 인데 이값으로 h_\\theta(x) = 800 -1.5x 을 그려보면 좌측과 같다. 실제 데이터(training data) X plot을 전혀 따라가고 있지 못하다. J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  의 값또한 최소값(중심부) 에서 멀리 떨어져있기 때문에 꽤 높은 비용을 쓰고 있다.     \n따라서 더 좋은 Hypothesis function h는 Cost function J의 최소값과 비슷할 수록 더 좋다.     \n참고로 앞으로는 더 많은 parameter \\theta를 사용할것이다. 그렇게 되면 더이상 그래프로는 표현할 수 없다.  더 많은 parameter \\theta를 사용한다는 의미는 h_\\theta(x) 함수 형태가 더 복잡해진다는 의미이다. 이것은 더 실세계를 정확히 반영할 것이다.     \n결국 우리가 해야할 것은 S/W를 사용해서  \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 그리고 함수 J의 최소값을 찾는것이다.다음 챕터에서는 J가 최소화 되도록 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1을 자동으로  찾는 알고리즘에 대해 알아볼 것이다.     \n1.2.7. Parameter Learning (Gradient Descent)\n\n지금까지 hypothesis function, h 에 대해 알아보았고 cost function을 통해 h의 parameter(\\theta)값에 따라 실제 세계의 데이터(training data)를 얼마나 잘 반영하는지 측정하는 방법에 대해 알아보았다.이전 장에서 \\theta 값에 따라 h의 정확도가 어떻게 향상되는지는 알아봤지만, 어떻게 \\theta 값을 찾는지는 아직 모른다.이번에는 가장 적합한 hypothesis function의 공식을 구성하는 parameter(\\theta)들을 어떻게 추정(estimate) 하는지 알아본다. -> gradient descent     \n1.2.8. Gradient Descent 알고리즘 수학적 정의\nGradient Descent알고리즘은 Cost function, J() 의 최소값을 찾기 위해 사용할 수 있다.  Gradient Descent 알고리즘은 Linear Regression 에만 쓸 수 있는건 아니고, 범용적인 알고리즘이다.     \n\n기본 아이디어     \n어떤 값으로 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 를 초기화하여 시작한다 (보통 0)    \nJ(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)를 최소화 하는 방향으로 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1를 변화시킨다.

Multivariate Linear Regression\n\n이번 챕터에서는 하나 이상의 variable 또는 하나 이상의 feature를 사용하는 보다 강력한 Linear regression에 대해 알아볼 것이다.     \n2.1.1. Multiple Features\n지금까지는 x (집 크기) 라는 하나의 feature만 사용했다. 이것을 집의 가격을 결정(예측)하는 요소로 사용했다.     \n그런데 집값을 결정짓는 요소는 집 크기하나 말고도 더 많을 수 있다. 이럴때 Linear regrresion을 어떻게 할수 있을까? 다음의 예시처럼 집의 크기와 방의 갯수, 층수, 연식 등등으로 고려해서 집값을 예측(결정) 할 수 있을 것이다.     \n    \n4개의 feature를 이용해 집값을 예측해 보자.     \n먼저 새로운 notation은 다음과 같이 정의한다.     \n    \n\n이 예시에서 4개의 feature가 있으므로 n = 4이다. (m은 테이블의 행의 갯수(training data의 갯수)임에 유의)    \n여기서 x^{(2)}는 두번째 training set(두번째 행)의 데이터를 가진 4차원 vector다.x^{(2)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1416 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 40 \\end{bmatrix}다시말해 두번째 집의 가격을 결정짓는 요소들이다.추가로 아래첨자는 feature 번호다. 가령 x^{(2)}_3는 테이블에서 2를 가리킨다.     \n\nfeature가 늘어났으므로 Hypothesis function의 형태도 달라져야한다.     \n  \npreviously:\\\\    \n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x \\\\    \n  \nnew :\\\\    \n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_2 + \\theta_3x_3 + \\theta_4x_4    \n  \n가령 이 예제에서 hypothesis function은 다음과 같을 수 있다.(\\theta_4 가 -2인 이유는 집이 오래될 수록 집값은 떨어지기 때문이다. )결국 h_\\theta(x) 에서 \\theta_j는 feature x_j에대한 가중치라고 볼수 있다.   \n  \n h_\\theta(x) = 80 + 0.1x_1 + 0.01x_2 + 3x_3 - 2x_4    \n  \n결국 n개의 feature가 있다면 가설함수는 아래와 같다.     \n    \nFeature 벡터 X와 parameter 벡터 \\theta가 있다.  결국 X는 n차원 벡터고 \\theta 도 만찬가지로 n차원 벡터다.이 두 벡터를 곱하면 h_\\theta(x) 가 된다!곱셈의 편의를 위해서 \\theta 벡터는 transpose 한다. (nx1, nx1 끼리는 곱셈불가하기 때문에  1xn * nx1 의 형태로 변경해야함)따라서 hypothesis function은  h_\\theta(x) = \\theta^TX  같이 간략히 표현된다!    \n  \n\\begin{align*}h_\\theta(x) =\\begin{bmatrix}\\theta_0 \\hspace{2em} \\theta_1 \\hspace{2em} ... \\hspace{2em} \\theta_n\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline \\vdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix}= \\theta^T x\\end{align*}    \n  \n이것을 Multivariate Linear regression 이라고 부른다    \n\n추측하기로는 결국 다변수 선형회귀도 궁극적으로 해결하려는 것은  training set의 데이터를 가지고 \\theta_n 들을 구하는것일 것이다. 그 \\theta 로 이루어진 h_\\theta()는  training set을 가장 유사하게 모사하는함수다.  여기서도 cost function J()를 새롭게 정의하게 될듯     \n\n2.1.2. Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables\n    \n\ncost function 자체는 동일하다.여기서 여러개의 parameter \\theta_0 ... \\theta_n 는 모두 간단하게 벡터 \\theta 로 바꿔서 표기할 수있다.      \n\nfeature가 1개 이상일때 Gradient Descent 알고리즘을 아래와같고 결국 각 \\theta 는 그 아래와같이 계산 될 수 있다. 개념상 이해하는데는 feature 가 1개일때랑 크게 차이가 없다.      \n    \n우리가 최종 계산할 parameter \\theta_0 ... \\theta_n 계산 공식!    \n  \n\\begin{align*} & \\text{repeat until convergence:} \\; \\lbrace \\newline \\; & \\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_0^{(i)}\\newline \\; & \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_1^{(i)} \\newline \\; & \\theta_2 := \\theta_2 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_2^{(i)} \\newline & \\cdots \\newline \\rbrace \\end{align*}    \n  \n2.1.3. Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling\nFeature Scaling 이란?     \n만약 여러개의 feature가 비슷한 크기의 범위를 갖는 값이라면 Gradient Descent가 더 빠르게 수렴할 수 있다.  더 적은 수의 반복으로 목적지에 수렴이 가능하다.     \n가령 x_1 값이 0 ~ 2000 의 범위를 갖고 x_2는 1 ~ 5 의 범위를 갖는다고 가정하면 그 두개의 feature의 범위 차이가 매우 크기 때문에 왼쪽 처럼 등고선이 매우 길쭉하게 나타난다. 그러면 기울기 하강은 더 난해하고 복잡한 경로로 오랫동안 일어나게 된다. 만약 우측처럼 범위를 동일하게 맞춰주면 등고선의 모양은 거의 원형이라 더 빠르게 하강할 수 있다.     \n따라서 이렇게 각 feature의 scale을 비슷하게 조정할 필요가 있다. (정확하게 똑같이 맞출필요는없다. 대충 비슷하게만 맞으면 된다.)  이것이 이번장에서 다룰 Feature Scaling이다.     \n    \n\nFeature Scaling 기법중 하나는 Mean normalization이다. 이것은 x를 대략 -0.5 ~ 0.5 범위로 scale 시킨다. 방법은     \n\n  \nx_n := {x_n - \\mu_n \\over s_n}    \n  \n\n\\mu_1 은 x_1의 평균이다.s_1 은 보통 최대값-최소값으로 하면된다.     \n\n2.1.4. Gradient Descent in Practice II - Learning Rate\n이번 챕터에서는 learning rate \\alpha를 어떻게 정하는지 알아본다.     \nGradient Descent가 잘동작한다면 j()는 매 iteration마다 감소해야한다.     \n300 회 반복 부터는 cost function 이 거의 줄어들지 않고 수렴한다.Gradient Descent 가 수렴하는 iteration 횟수는? 경우에 따라 다양하기 때문에 사전에 알기 어렵다.     \nAutomatic Convergence Test라는 Gradient Descent 가 수렴하는지 안하는지 알려주는 test가 존재 하기도 한다.    \n만약 J 가 감소하지 않고 증가한다면 명백한 문제가 있는것이고, 더 작은 learning rate \\alpha 사용해야한다는 뜻이다.     \n적절한 learning rate \\alpha 알아서 찾아서 좋은 Gradient Descent를 구현해야한다. 특별히 정답은 없는듯.    \nTo summarize:    \n\nIf \\alphaα is too small: slow convergence.    \nIf \\alphaα is too large: ￼may not decrease on every iteration and thus may not converge.    \n\n2.1.5. Features and Polynomial Regression\n이번챕터 에서는 어떻게 Feature를 선택할지, 적절한 Feature의 선택으로 강력한 학습 알고리즘을 만드는 방법에대해 알아본다. Polynomial Regression(다항 회귀?)에 대해서도 알아본다.  Polynomial Regression은 linear regression 을이용해서 복잡한 비선형 함수에도 적용하는 것이다.     \n    \n이런경우는 굳이 x_2 까지 항을 늘려서 모델(가설함수)을 만들 필요가 없다.x_1을 넓이로 바로 사용해도 된다.     \n이런 형태의 training data가 존재한다고 하자.    \nhypothesis function이 h_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1  일 때, x1 에 연관된 feature를 추가하여 2차 함수꼴로 만들 수 있다.  \nh_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^2    \n여기서 \\theta_2 x_1^2 가 x_2^2 가 아니라 x_1^2 임을 유의하자. 결국 feature는 하나인것이다.하나의 feature를 가지고 제곱이나 제곱근등등으로 형태를 변경하여 함수모양을 바꿀수 있다. 이것은 결국 feature가 하나 더 늘어나는것과 같은 의미이다. 결국x_1 = x_1x_2 = (x_1)^2와 같다.     \n이차함수형태의 모델을 사용하면 나중에 감소하는 구간이 생기기에 적합하지 않다.이럴땐 3차 함수 형태를 사용하는게 더 적합하다.  \nh_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^3 + \\theta_3 x_1^3    \n이렇게 3차 함수꼴로 나타냈을때그리고 아래와 같이 제곱근 형태의 함수를 사용하는게 더 적합할 수도 있다.  \nh_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 \\sqrt{x_1}    \n  \n이러한 함수형태를 자동으로 찾아주는 알고리즘이 존재한다. 앞으로는 그것을 사용할것이다.     \n중요한것은 이렇게 feature 하나를 가지고 새로운 feature를 만들면 feature scaling이 중요해진다.x_1이 1~1000 범위를 갖는다면, 그로부터 만든 새 feature인 (x_1)^2는 1 ~ 1000000 의 범위를 갖게 될것이기 때문이다. 이 둘의 차이가 너무 크면 gradient descent 가 엄청 느려진다.     \n\nPolynomial feature  생성하는 방법:만약 training data의 feature가  x_1  x_2 이렇게 주어진다면, 그 두개의 feature 벡터를 가지고 다음의 polynomial feature 값을 모두 연산하여 새로운 matrix를 생성한다. 그리고 각 polynomial feature에 해당하는 가중치  \\theta 를 적절하게 선택(Gredient descent등 사용)하여, Polynomial한 h_\\theta(x) 함수를 생성할 수 있는것이다.  \nx_1 , x_2 , x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1x_2, x_1^3, x_1^2x_2, x_1x_2^2 , x_2^3, ....  \nTraining set을 가지고 그 데이터를 잘 모사하는 h_\\theta(x)를 만들때, 함수형태를 먼저 찾는것이 아니다. 모든 형태를 만든다음에  x 의 parameter (혹은 weight)  \\theta를 0으로 만들던지 하여 불필요한 항을 제거하는 방식으로 함수 형태를 찾는것이다.    \n\nPolynomial feature  생성 알고리즘(in Octave):연습문제 ex2_reg.m 의 mapFeature.m 참고  \n  X = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2));\n\n\nx_1, x_2a feature가 X벡터에 있을때  \n\n  function out = mapFeature(X1, X2)  \n\n  degree = 6;        % 몇차 polynomial feature까지 생성할 것인지  \n  out = ones(size(X1(:,1)));  \n  for i = 1:degree  \n      for j = 0:i  \n      out(:, end+1) = (X1.^(i-j)).*(X2.^j);  \n      end  \n  end  \n  end\n\n\n\n"},"documents/2.2-computing-parameters-analytically.html":{"url":"documents/2.2-computing-parameters-analytically.html","title":"2.2.

Normal Equation\nNormal Equation은 최적의 \\theta 를 구할 수 있는 또다른 방법이다.  gradient descent 와는 다른 방식으로 각각 장/단점이 있다.     \nNormal Equation은 \\theta 를 반복계산 없이 공식하나로 한번에 구할 수 있다.다음의 training set을 보자.     \n    \n\n4개의 feature가 있고 결과가 있다. 이것을 각각 X matrix와 y 벡터로 복사한다. 계산의 편의를 위해  1을 갖는 x_0 열이 추가되었음에 유의. 이것을가지도 아래 Normal Equation 공식에 대입해 계산하면 바로 \\theta를 구할 수 있다!    \n\n  \n\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty    \n  \n이렇게 계산된 \\theta 는 cost function J를 최소화하는 값이다.     \n    \n만약 i번째 하나의 training data가 위의 x^{(i)} 처럼 n + 1 크기의 벡터로 주어진다면, 이것으로 우측과 같이 Design Matrix X를 만든다. (결국 이전 예시처럼 테이블을 그대로 matrix에 복사한것과 동일한 구성임)    \n더 간단한 예를들면 아래와 같다.    \n\\theta 를 구하는 Octave 명령어    \npinv(X'*X)*X'*y\n\n반복 계산도 필요없고 적절한 \\alpha를 찾아야하는 수고가 없다. 또한 Feature scaling도 필요없다. 이렇게 좋은 방법이 있다니?그러나 결론적으로Normal Equation에 매우 치명적인 단점이 있다. n(feature갯수)가 엄청 커지면 Normal Equation은 못쓴다. 복잡도가 O(n^3) 으로 연산속도가 엄청나게 느려지기 때문이다.     \nGradient descent 와 Normal equation을 비교하면 아래와 같다.    \n보통 n=10000 정도까지는 Normal equations을 사용해도 괜찮다고 한다. 현대 컴퓨팅 파워로 이정도계산 까지는 실용적인 속도를 얻을 수 있다.     \n2.2.2. Normal Equation Noninvertibility\n역행렬이 없는 Normal Equation은 어떻게 구해야할까?  \n\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty    \nX^TX 가 역행렬이 없는 경우가 있기 때문이다.     \n다음의 두가지 경우에 X^TX 에 역행렬이 없다.    \n\n1번은 각 feature가 x_1 = (3.28)^2x_2 처럼 선형적으로 종속적인 관계일때이다. 이럴땐 둘 중 한feature를 제거해도 된다.두번째는 피쳐갯수(n)이 training set갯수(m)보다 많을때이다. 이럴땐 어떤 feature들을 지우거나, regularization기법을 사용한다.      \n\n"},"documents/3-logistic-regression-regularization.html":{"url":"documents/3-logistic-regression-regularization.html","title":"3.

Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam.  \n3.1.1. Classfication\n\n이번 챕터에서는 어떻게 Classfication 분류 알고리즘을 어떻게 개발할수 있는지 알아본다.우선 linear regression을 classification에 적용하는것은 가능해보이기는 하나. 데이터가 동떨어진 곳에 하나만 추가되어도 가설함수가 바뀌기 때문에 옳지 못한 결과를 만들어낼 수 있다.  \n따라서 y가 0또는 1인 binary classification problem 에 집중할것이다.   \n3.1.2. Logistic Regression\n\n(용어는 Regression 이지만 Classfication 문제임)  \nLogistic Regression 에서 아래와 같은 범위를 갖는 가설함수를 만들것이다.  \n0 \\leq h_\\theta(x) \\leq 1  \n  \n  \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta (x) = g ( \\theta^T x ) \\newline \\newline& z = \\theta^T x \\newline& g(z) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\\end{align*}  \n  \n그렇게 하기 위해서는 가설함수 h_\\theta(x)를 g(z) 형태로 변화시켜야한다. 그 이유는 0 \\leq h_\\theta(x) \\leq 1를 만족시키도록 만들기 위해서이다. 그래프로 그리면 시그모이드 함수의 형태로 나타나고 범위가 1이하 0이상을 만족한다. 이제 우리가할일은 \\theta 파라미터를 우리의 데이터에 맞게 맞추는것이다. 파라미터를 찾는 알고리즘은 후에 다시 살펴본다.   \n  \ng(z)의 결과는 항상 0 이상 1이하를 만족한다.  \nh(x)는 입력값 x에대해서 y가 1일 확률을 추청하는 함수이다.가령 위그림과 같이 x의 feature가 두개 즉 feature 벡터 x가 있을때. (하나는 1, 하나는 종양크기) 만약 가설함수가 0.7로 나왔다면, 결과를 이렇게 해석할 수 있다. y=1일 확률 즉 악성종양일 확률이 70%이라고.   \n이것을 수학적으로 더 엄밀하게 표현하면 아래와 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \\theta) = 1 - P(y=0 | x ; \\theta) \\newline&  \nP(y = 0 | x;\\theta) + P(y = 1 | x ; \\theta) = 1\\end{align*}  \n  \n\nh_\\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \\theta)  해석: Probability that y=1, given x, parameterized by \\thetay가 1일 가능성, 주어진 x, 즉 환자가 특징 x로 나타내지는 특정 종양의 크기를 가질때, 이것이 \\theta에 매개된 가능성이다.   \n\n3.1.3. Decision Boundary\n\nh(x)가 계산하는것이 정확히 무엇이냐? 가설함수가 예측하는 값이 언제 y=1이고 0인지 이해해보자.   \n  \n가령 h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 일때 y = 1이라고 가정한다면, h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta^T x) \\geq 0.5  와 같다. 그래프를 보면 z \\geq 0일때 g(z) \\geq 0.5이므로 z = \\theta^Tx \\geq 0 일때 와 같다.   \n즉 \\theta^Tx \\geq 0 이면, y = 1 로 예측할 수 있다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 \\rightarrow y = 1 \\newline& h_\\theta(x)   \n  \n가령 h(x) 가 위처럼 g(\\theta^Tx) 형태일때, \\theta 벡터가  \\theta = \\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} 라고 가정하면, \\theta^Tx  가 0보다 큰 경우, 즉 y=1일 경우는 그래프가 나타태는 영역과 같다. x_1 x_2는 training set이다.  x_1 + x_2 \\geq 0 이 나타내는 영역이 y=1인것이다.  이때 h(x) = g(\\theta^Tx) \\geq 0.5를 만족한다.이 경계를 나타내는 함수를 Decision Boundary 라고 부른다!  \nThe decision boundary is the line that separates the area where y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function.  \n실제로(x_1, x_2)이 (1,1)과 (3,3)일때 h_\\theta(x)를 계산해보면 다음과 같다.   \n\n(3,3)일때 -> \\theta^Tx = 3  \n  octave:6> 1 / (1 + e^-(3))  \n  ans =  0.95257\n\n\n0.5보다 큼 -> y=1 일확률 95%  \n\n\n(1,1)일때 -> \\theta^Tx = -1  \n  octave:7> 1 / (1 + e^-(-1))  \n  ans =  0.26894\n\n\n0.5보다 작음 -> y=1 일 확률 27%  \n\n\n\n3.1.4. Non-linear Decision Boundary\n\n  \n일반적인 경우 logistic regression은 linear한 decision boundary 밖에 찾을 수 없다. (since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary)따라서 Decision Boundary가 non-linear한 경우의 예는 위와 같다. (\\theta^Tx) 는 feature 두개를(x_1 x_2) 가지고Polynomial 한 변수를 사용했음에 유의 (x_1^2 x_2^2)\\theta가 Decision Boundary 모양을 결정한다 training data가 하는게 아님.  \nPolynomial 한 feature를 더 복합적으로 사용하면 더 복잡한 모양의 Decision Boundary를 얻을 수 있다.   \n\n추측하기로 결국 이 3 장에서 할일은. training set x가 있을때 적절한 Decision Boundary함수 그래프 모형(?)을 선택하고 \\theta 를 구한다. 최적의 \\theta는 당연히도 cost function J(\\theta)를 최소화하는 값으로 구할것이다. 그렇게 해서 구해진 가설함수 h_\\theta(x)는 주어진 x가 y=1영역인지 아닌지를 판단해준다. 확률값으로.  \n3.1.5. Cost function\n\n이번 챕터에서는 어떻게 적절한 parameter \\theta를 구할수 있는지 알아본다.   \n  \n\nm개의 Training set이 위와같고,  feature 벡터 x 가 위와 같을때.  \\theta를 어떻게 선택할 수 있을까?  \n\nLogistic regression의 cost function 은 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& J(\\theta) = \\dfrac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(h_\\theta(x)) \\; & \\text{if y = 1} \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(1-h_\\theta(x)) \\; & \\text{if y = 0}\\end{align*}  \n  \n\ny=1일때, y=0일때 다르다.   \n\nJ(\\theta)는 training examples의 모든 i에 대한 합이고 하나의 i에 해당하는 Cost(h_\\theta(x), y)는 예시는 아래와 같다.참고로 Linear regression에서 cost function은 \"실제값과 예측값의 차이\"였다. Logistic regression 에서는 log함수 형태를 선택했다. 예측값(y= 0또는 1)이 실제값(y= 0또는 1)과 가까우면 0이고 틀리면 무한대가 된다. 결국 개념상 예측값(h_\\theta(x), y=1일 확률값) 과 실제값(y)의 차이인것은 동일하다.  Logistic regression은 실제값 y가 0또는 1밖에 없기 때문에 cost func를 두개로 나눌수 있는것.   \n참고: m개의 training data가 필요한 시점은 언제부터 인가? 다시 말해 m개의 데이터를 통해 학습하는 단계는 언제부터인가?-> Cost function J(\\theta)를 계산하는 시점이다. J(\\theta)는 각 training set으로 부터 계산된 값을 모두 더해야하기 때문이다. 이 지점을 Learning 한다고 표현하는것 같다.   \n만약 y=1일때 cost function J(\\theta)는 아래와 같이 그릴 수 있다. x축인 h_\\theta(x) 의 범위는 0 에서 1사이이다.  \n반대로 y=0일때는 다음과 같다.  \n만약 y=1로 예측을 하는 cost 함수에서 h_\\theta(x) = 0 이 나오면 대단한 오류이기 때문에 cost즉 J(\\theta)가 무한대이다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = 0 \\text{ if } h_\\theta(x) = y \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 0 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 1 \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 1 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 0 \\newline \\end{align*}  \n  \n3.1.6. Simplified Cost Function and Gradient Descent\n\n\nCost Function  \n\ny=1일때와 0일때 경우로 나뉜 cost function은 아래와같이 하나의 식으로 합칠수 있다. y=1과 y=0을 대입해보면 동일하다.  \n그리고 J(\\theta)는 아래와 같은 공식으로 나타낼 수 있다.   \n  \n이것을 Vectorized 하면 아래와 같다. 실제 Octave로 계산할때는 아래의 식을 사용한다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*} & h = g(X\\theta)\\newline & J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\left(-y^{T}\\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\\log(1-h)\\right) \\end{align*}  \n  \n\nGredient Descent 알고리즘.   \n\n\\theta_j 를 구하는 알고리즘도 아래와 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline & \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta) \\newline & \\rbrace\\end{align*}  \n  \n편미분해서 도함수(Derivative)를 대입하면   \n  \n\\begin{align*} & Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline & \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)} \\newline & \\rbrace \\end{align*}  \n  \n결국 Gredient Descent 알고리즘이 Linear regression과 완벽히 동일 하다!!(각 \\theta 값은 동시에(simultaniously) 계산되어야하는 것도 마찬가지)  \n  \n\nLinear regression 과 딱하나 차이가 있다면 h_\\theta(x) 의 형태이다.   \n\nLinear regressionh_\\theta(x) = \\theta^Tx    \nLogistic regressionh_\\theta(x) = {1 \\over (1 + e^{-\\theta^Tx})}  \n\n\n결국 Vectorized 하면  \\theta는 아래와 같이 구할 수 있다.    \n  \n3.1.7. Advanced Optimization\n\nFor logistic regression, sometimes gradient descent will converge to a local minimum (and fail to find the global minimum). This is the reason we prefer more advanced optimization algorithms such as fminunc (conjugate gradient/BFGS/L-BFGS/etc).  \nOctave 라이브러리 fminunc() 사용, theta vector를 Gradient descent보다 빨리 찾을 수 있음.https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/cmjIc/advanced-optimization  \n3.1.8. Multi-Class Classification\n\n아래 예와 같이, 이메일을 여러 태그로 분류하는 경우등, 두개 이상으로 분류하는 경우는 어떻게 하는지 알아보자.   \n  \n아래와 같이, 3가지로 분류해야 한다면, One vs All 형태의 가설함수를 3개를 만들면 된다. 그뒤에 예측할때는 x에대해서 세개의 가설함수 전부를 돌려보고 결과인 y=1일 확률이 가장 높은 class로 선택하면 된다.   \n  \n이것을 수식으로 표현하면  \n  \n\\begin{align*}& y \\in \\lbrace0, 1 ... n\\rbrace \\newline& h_\\theta^{(0)}(x) = P(y = 0 | x ; \\theta) \\newline& h_\\theta^{(1)}(x) = P(y = 1 | x ; \\theta) \\newline& \\cdots \\newline& h_\\theta^{(n)}(x) = P(y = n | x ; \\theta) \\newline& \\mathrm{prediction} = \\max_i( h_\\theta ^{(i)}(x) )\\newline\\end{align*}  \n  \n\nh_\\theta^{(0)}(x) 부터  h_\\theta^{(n)}(x) 까지 다 돌려보고 그중에 가장 큰값을 갖는 i를 선택하면 된다.    \n\n"},"documents/3.2-regularization-and-overfitting-problem.html":{"url":"documents/3.2-regularization-and-overfitting-problem.html","title":"3.2.

Overfitting problem\n\n3.2.1. Overfitting 이란?\n  \nFeature를 많이 둘 수록 Training data을 더 정확히 모사할 수 있다.  하지만 가설함수가 너무 Training data에만 적합해서 Training data는 거의 정확하게 예측하지만 새로 들어온 데이터에 대해서는 예측을 못하는 문제가 발생할수 있다.  해당 가설함수로 문제를 일반화(generalize)하는것을 실패함.그림맨 왼쪽은 Underfit (high bias, preconception 이라고도 표현할수 있음), 오른쪽이 Overfit, 가운데가 적합함.  \n강의 뒷편에서 학습알고리즘이 Overfitting인지 아닌지 분석하는 툴에대해 살펴볼 것이다.   \nFeature가 너무 많을때 Overfitting이 발생할 수 있다. 해결책은 크게 두가지이다.   \n\n1) Reduce the number of features:  \n\nManually select which features to keep.  \nUse a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).  \n\n\n2) Regularization  \n\nKeep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters \\theta_jθ   \nRegularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.이번 장에서 다룰 내용  \n\n\n\n3.2.2. Cost function\n  \nRegularization 은 이렇게 cost function 에 특정\\theta_j에 큰 가중치를 부여(패널티 부여)해서 최종적으로 \\theta_j 의 크기를 0에 가깝게 만드는것이다. 이렇게하면 4차 함수를 쓰더라도 2차함수 모델에 근접하게 만들 수 있다.   \n  \n그렇다면 어떤 \\theta_i를 선택해서 Regularization할 것인가? 우리는 어떤게 맞는지 알수없다. 그래서  다음의 공식으로 모든 parameter  \\theta_i에 대해서 값을 줄여(shrink)서 cost function값을 확인해 보는 것이다.  J(\\theta) 의 공식에 \\color{royalblue}{+ \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2} 부분이 추가된다.   \nIn regularized linear regression, we choose \\theta to minimize:   \n\nJ(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( h_\\theta( x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \\right)^2 \\color{royalblue}{+ \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2} \n\nThe \\lambda is the regularization parameter. It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated.  \n어떤 \\lambda를 적용 했을때, 모든 \\theta에대해서 가장 cost function이 작아지는지 확인?  \n어떤 feature에 대한 parameter \\theta_j 가 있을때 그 파라미터에대해서  J(\\theta)를 구해보면, 왼쪽항은 줄어들지만, 람다항 + \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2은 커진다. 이 둘의 조합을 통해 결국 가장 작은 값을 갖는 \\theta_j 를 찾으면 overfitting을 방지한 \\theta값을 찾을 수 있을 것이다.   \n\\lambda 가 또 너무 커도 Underfitting이 발생할 수도 있음에 주의해야 한다.  \n3.2.3. Regularized Linear Regression\nOverfitting 을 피하기 위해서 Linear Regression 에서 Regularized하는 방법에 대해 알아보자.   \nRegularized 를 Gradient descent 알고리즘에 적용하면 다음과 같다. \\theta_0인 경우는 seperated 되었다는점에 주의 (어차피 1이기 때문이다.)  \n  \n\n분홍색 부분은 J(\\theta)를 편미분한 도함수이다. 증명은 생략한다.   \n\n\\theta_j 항을 모아서 쓰면 다음과 같다.  \n1 - \\alpha {\\lambda \\over m} 항(term)은 흥미로운 영향을 준다.  1 - \\alpha {\\lambda \\over m}  이다. 그리고  \\theta_j 자체를 약간 줄인다. 그 우측 항은 기존 gradient descent 와 동일하다.   \nNormal Equation 은 어떻게 적용할 수있는지 살펴보자.간단하다 공식은 아래와 같다.

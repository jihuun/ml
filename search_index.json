Linear Regression with One Variable\n\n1.2.1. Model and Cost Function\n\n이번장에서는 Linear regression 알고리즘에 대해 알아보고 Model에 대해서 그리고 지도학습의 전체 과정에 대해서 알아볼 것이다.Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.    \n1.2.2 Linear Regression\n그림과 같은 데이터가 있을때, 1250 사이즈의 집이 있다고 치면, 얼마의 값으로 팔면 좋을지 예측하는 문제가 있다고 하자. 가장 먼저 해볼 수 있는것은 Model을 만드는 것이다. 가장 간단한 모델은 그림의 분홍색 그래프처럼 linear 한 선을 그어보는 것이다.이것이 Supervised learning의 한 예시이다. 그이유는 이 문제에서 나의 문제(팔 가격 예측)에 적합한 답을 주기 때문이다.     \n    \n이것은 traning set이라고 하는 data set이다. 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 이 데이터로부터 어떻게 주택 가격을 예측할지 학습시키는 것이다.     \n    \n다음의 notation을 사용한다.     \nm: 학습 데이터 갯수x: input값, featurey: output, target    \n위의 그림에서 x_1 = 2104,  x_2 = 1416, y_1 = 406 이다.    \n1.2.3. Model Representation\nHypothesis Function (가설 함수)    \n    \n\ntraining set 데이터를 학습 알고리즘을 거치면 함수가 나오는데 그것을 h라고 표기한다. Hypothesis Function 이라고 부른다.    \n\nHypothesis Function은 다음과 같이 수식으로 나타낼 수 있다.     \n  \nh_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x    \n  \n1.2.4. Cost Function (비용함수)\nCost Function으로 Hypothesis Function의 정확도를 평가할 수 있다.h(x) 함수는 아래와같이 표현된다.\\theta_0 \\theta_1 을 어떻게 선택하느냐에 따라 h(x)는 아래 그림과 같다.결국 목적은 주어진 training set을 가지고, a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y 하도록 학습하는 것이다.     \n    \n결국 세타0 세타1 을 적절하게 선택하여 h(x) - y (예측값 - 실제값)의 차이가 최소화가 되도록하면 된다.그것을 찾는 방법을 공식화하면 다음과 같다. 이것이 Cost Function이다.J()로 표현되는 이 Cost Function은 오차함수의 제곱이라도고 불린다. 이 제곱함수는 회귀분석에서 가장 많이 사용된다. (제곱을 하는 이유는 음수, 또는 미분을 해야하기 때문으로 생각됨)     \n    \n\ntraining set에서 각 (예측값i - 실제값i)을 제곱하고 합을구한뒤 평균을 낸다.      \n\n    \n결국 목적은 Cost Function을 최소화 하는것이다. Cost Function이 작아질 수록 Hypothesis Function의 정확도는 향상된다.    \n  \nh_\\theta(x) 정확도 \\propto {1 \\over J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)}    \n  \n1.2.5. Simplified Cost function of Linear Regression\n가설/비용함수 개념을 더 잘 이해하기 위해서 우리는 \\theta_0 를 0으로 만든 단순화 버전을 사용할 것이다.  단순화 시킨 h_\\theta(x) 의 그래프는 원점을 지난다.정리하면 다음과 같다.     \n\n\n\n\nbasic\nsimplified\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x \n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_1 \n\n\nParametears:\n \\theta_0 , \\theta_1 \n \\theta_1 \n\n\nCost Function:\n J(\\theta_0 , \\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \n J(\\theta_1) = \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 \n\n\nGoal:\n \\underset{\\theta_0 , \\theta_1}{minimize} \\ J(\\theta_0 , \\theta_1) \n \\underset{\\theta_1}{minimize} \\ J(\\theta_1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n가설함수  h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_1 \n비용함수   J(\\theta_1) \n\n\n\n\ninput값 x 에 대한 함수\nparameter \\theta 에 대한 함수 (직선의 기울기를 좌우함)\n\n\n\n다음과 같은 Training Data가 주어졌다고 하자.     \n    \n\n먼저 실제 데이터(Training data) X가 x-y평면에 흩뿌려져 있다.(그림과 다르게 더 불규칙할 수 있음) 우리 목적은 최대한 그 데이터를 잘 모사 할 수 있는 직선h_\\theta(x)을 찾는것이다.     \n\n이제 \\theta_1의 값에 따른 가설함수와 cost 함수의 관계가 어떻게 변화하는지 살펴보자.     \na. \\theta_1 = 1 일때\n결론적으로 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 은 실제 데이터(Training data)와 정확히 일치하게 되고, 이 예시 데이터에서  J(1) 은  0으로 우리의 목적인 최소값이 된다.(예측값 - 실제값)이 0이 된다.     \n    \n\n그래프 설명: 왼쪽의 plot X는 \"실제 값\"(Training data)이다. 거기에 \"예측 값\"인 h_\\theta(x) 을 그렸다.우측: \\theta_1 = 1 일때  J(\\theta_1)  값은 0이 된다.   J(1) = 0  이다.그리고 h_\\theta(x) = x 가 된다. 실제 데이터도 y=x 를 따라 위치해있으므로 두 데이터가 정확히 일치한다.가령 집 크기가 2일때 예측한 짒값은 2인데 실제 집값도 2이다. 라는 의미    \n\n실제 데이터가 y=x 를 따라 무한히 주어지지는 않을 테지만, 비용함수 계산 결과 0으로 나오므로 여기서 우리가 선택한 직선인 h_\\theta(x) 는 실세계를 정확히 거의 예측할 수 있는 것이다. 결국 Linear Regression은 실제 이미 알고있는 유한한 데이터를 기반으로 모르는 값을 예측/추측 할때 사용한다.     \n    \n\n질문: (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 에서 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 의 결과는 예측값이고 y^{(i)}는 실제 값이다. 그런데 아래 h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) 그래프에서 y축은 예측값이지 실제 값이 아니지 않은가?     \n그래프에서 y 축은 실제값을 나타내는게 맞다. h_\\theta(x^{(i)})가 찍는 그래프는 y에 대한 예측값을 찍는것이다. 반면 X로 표기된 값이 실제 값이다.  여기서 설명하는 linear regression은 supervised learning이기 때문에 주어진 training set(data set)의 y값 즉 정답을 이미 다 알고있다는 가정하에 한다. 따라서 (예측값-실제값)이 맞다.\\theta_1가 1일때는 예측 모델(?) 예측값이 실제값과 동일해진다는것을 설명한 것이다.따라서 실제 training set과 h 그래프는 위와 같이 표현되는게 더 정확하다.위 연습문제를 계산해보면 결과는 아래와 같음    \n  \n> \\begin{matrix}    \n> J(0) &=& {1 \\over 2 \\times 3} \\times ((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 +(0 - 3)^2) \\\\    \n>    &=& {14 \\over 6}     \n> \\end{matrix}    \n>   \n\nb. \\theta_1 = 0.5 일때\n    \n\n가령 집 크기(x)가 2일때 예측한 짒값(y)은 1이었는데, 실제 집값은 2었다는 의미    \n\nc. \\theta_1 = 0 그리고  \\theta_1 = n일때\n    \n1.2.6. Cost function of Linear Regression\n이제 \\theta_0 를 사용한 실제 Cost function 을 살펴보자\\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 이 모두 존재하기 때문에 Cost function  J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  는 그림과 같이 3차원 그래프가 될 것이다.    \n3차원 그래프는 아래 우측과 같이 보기편하게 Countour plot(등고선 그래프)으로 변경해서 사용할것이다. 위에서 내려다 본 모습과 일치하고 같은 등고선은 같은 높이의  J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) 를 의미한다.    \n우측 그래프의 빨간점 x 는 \\theta_0 = 800  \\theta_1 = -1.5 인데 이값으로 h_\\theta(x) = 800 -1.5x 을 그려보면 좌측과 같다. 실제 데이터(training data) X plot을 전혀 따라가고 있지 못하다. J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  의 값또한 최소값(중심부) 에서 멀리 떨어져있기 때문에 꽤 높은 비용을 쓰고 있다.     \n따라서 더 좋은 Hypothesis function h는 Cost function J의 최소값과 비슷할 수록 더 좋다.     \n참고로 앞으로는 더 많은 parameter \\theta를 사용할것이다. 그렇게 되면 더이상 그래프로는 표현할 수 없다.  더 많은 parameter \\theta를 사용한다는 의미는 h_\\theta(x) 함수 형태가 더 복잡해진다는 의미이다. 이것은 더 실세계를 정확히 반영할 것이다.     \n결국 우리가 해야할 것은 S/W를 사용해서  \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 그리고 함수 J의 최소값을 찾는것이다.다음 챕터에서는 J가 최소화 되도록 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1을 자동으로  찾는 알고리즘에 대해 알아볼 것이다.     \n1.2.7. Parameter Learning (Gradient Descent)\n\n지금까지 hypothesis function, h 에 대해 알아보았고 cost function을 통해 h의 parameter(\\theta)값에 따라 실제 세계의 데이터(training data)를 얼마나 잘 반영하는지 측정하는 방법에 대해 알아보았다.이전 장에서 \\theta 값에 따라 h의 정확도가 어떻게 향상되는지는 알아봤지만, 어떻게 \\theta 값을 찾는지는 아직 모른다.이번에는 가장 적합한 hypothesis function의 공식을 구성하는 parameter(\\theta)들을 어떻게 추정(estimate) 하는지 알아본다. -> gradient descent     \n1.2.8. Gradient Descent 알고리즘 수학적 정의\nGradient Descent알고리즘은 Cost function, J() 의 최소값을 찾기 위해 사용할 수 있다.  Gradient Descent 알고리즘은 Linear Regression 에만 쓸 수 있는건 아니고, 범용적인 알고리즘이다.     \n\n기본 아이디어     \n어떤 값으로 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 를 초기화하여 시작한다 (보통 0)    \nJ(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)를 최소화 하는 방향으로 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1를 변화시킨다. (J가 최소값이 될때 까지)    \n\n\n\n    \n\n초기 지점부터 최소 지점으로 내려가야 한다. 어떻게 내려가는지 여러가지 알고리즘이 존재한다.어느 지점에서 시작을 하느냐에 따라 어떤 지점으로 도착할지가 다를 수 있다.참고 이 그래프와는 다르게 Linear regression에서는 cost function J의 최소점이 무조건 1개이다.    \n\n공식    \n  \n\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha{\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_j}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) \\\\    \n  \n    \n공식 해설    \n\n:=수학에서 기호 := 할당한다(assignment)의 의미이다.a := b, a := a + 1 은 컴퓨터 프로그래밍에서 변수에 값을 할당하는것과 동일하다.반면 a = b 는 주장(assertion)이다. a와 b가 같다고 주장하는 것이다. (컴퓨터 프로그램과 반대) 따라서 a = a + 1 는 틀린 공식이 된다. 왜냐하면 a와 a + 1은 절대 같은 값이 될 수 없기 때문이다.     \n\n\\alphaLearning Rate (훈련 비율) 수치 이다. 기본적으로 언덕을 내려갈 때 얼만큼 큰 걸음을 내 딛어야하는지를 상징한다. 가령  \\alpha가 크다면 매우 aggresive한 기울기 하강이 될것    \n\n{\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_j}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)생긴것 그대로 \\theta에 대한 함수 J의 미분 계수 이다. \\partial 편미분하강 방향은 J의 편미분값에 의해 결정된다.     \n\n(for j = 0 and j = 1)여기서는 j가 0일 때와 1일때를 다룬다.     \n\n\n이 공식을 update하기 위해서 아래의 과정을 통해 \\theta_0 과 \\theta_1 이 지속적으로 업데이트 되야한다.     \n temp0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha{\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_0}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)  temp1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha{\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_1}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) \\theta_0 := temp0\\theta_1 := temp1    \n\ntemp0 temp1을 먼저 계산한뒤 \\theta 에 할당하는 이유는 temp1 에서 미분계수를 계산할때 바뀐 \\theta_0 를 사용하지 않기 위함임을 주의해야한다.     \n\n1.2.9. Learning rate와 미분계수\n이번에도 더 쉬운 이해를 위해 \\theta_0 을 사용하지않고 parameter 하나만 사용, J(\\theta_1) 으로 단순화 시켜보자.    \n\n미분계수 {\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_j}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)    \n    \n\n그래프의 빨간점 지점의 J(\\theta_1)의 미분계수는 어떠한 양수값이다.따라서 \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha (양수값) 을 계산하면 \\theta_1은 점차 최저 J 값으로 이동하게 된다.     \n\n    \n\n미분계수가 음수인경우도 마찬가지로 \\theta_1이 점차 최저 J 값으로 이동하게 된다.     \n\n\nLearning Rate \\alpha    \n    \n\n\\alpha 가 작다면 매우 작은 스텝으로 하강할것이고 많은 이동이 필요하다. 하강 속도가 느릴것이다.     \n\n    \n\n만약 \\alpha 이 큰데 시작점이 최소값 지점과 가까이 있다면 최소값을 넘어서 반대방향으로 이동할 것이고 또다시 반대편으로 이동하게 될것이다. minimum 을 Overshoot하게 되는것이다. 방향 전환 조차도 실패한다.결국 수렴(converge) 에서 멀어지게 된다.     \n\n\n문제: 만약 parameter \\theta_1 이 이미 최소값이라면 어떤 각도로 하강해야할까?     \n\n\n    \n\n미분계수가 0 이기 때문에 그대로 \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - 0  이 되어 변동이 없다.     \n\n하강할 수록 점점 더 작은 거리를 이동하게 된다. 왜냐하면 최소값에 도달할수록 기울기가 작아지며 미분계수값이 작아지기 때문이다. 따라서 굳이 \\alpha값이 작아질 필요가 없다.     \n1.2.10. Gradient Descent for Linear Regression\n이제 Gradient Descent를 Linear Regression에 적용해보자.     \n    \n이제 우리가 하려는 것은 Gradient Descent 알고리즘을 사용해서 J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)를 최소화 하려는 것이다.     \nCost function J()를 알고리즘 공식에 대입하기만 하면 된다.     \n\n먼저 아래와 같이 알고리즘에서 미분계수 항 {\\partial \\over \\partial\\theta_j}J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) 에 대입하여 (a)로 풀어쓴뒤,  j=0, j=1일때 각각 편미분하면 \\theta_0  \\theta_1에 대한 미분계수 (b), (c)를 구할 수 있다.    \n\n이것을 Gradient Descent 알고리즘에 다시 대입하면 아래와 같다. 이제 \\theta_0  \\theta_1 값을 계산할 수 있는 알고리즘이 공식화 되었다.  \n\\begin{align*} \\text{repeat until convergence: } \\lbrace & \\newline \\theta_0 := & \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}(h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i}) \\newline \\theta_1 := & \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m}\\left((h_\\theta(x_{i}) - y_{i}) x_{i}\\right) \\newline \\rbrace& \\end{align*}    \n  \n\n\n초기에 주어진 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 을 가지고 모든 training set의 h(x^i) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x^i 와 y차의 합을 구한다. 공식에 따라 먼저 \\theta_0, \\theta_1에 해당하는 값을 구한뒤 그다음에 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 에 각각 대입한다. 그렇게 두번째 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 값을 구할 수 있는것이다. 이것을 반복하다보면 아래 그림과 같이 cost function J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)가 최소값이 되는 \\theta_0, \\theta_1 지점에 점차 수렴하게 된다(목적 달성). 당연히 \\theta_0, \\theta_1가 바뀔때마다 hypotheis function h(x)도 달라진다.    \n  \n(주의할 사항은 이 두값이 동시에(simultaneously) update 되어야한다는 점이다 \\theta_0, \\theta_1이 바뀔때 마다 가설 함수도 바뀌기 때문이다.  h(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x$$)    \n    \n이 알고리즘을 다른말로 Batch Gradient Descent 라고 부른다.지금 배운것은 cost function J의 최소값을 구하기 위해 반복적 알고리즘을 사용했다. 참고로 나중에는 반복이 없이도 J의 최소값을 구할 수 있는 방법에 대해 알아볼 것이다.     \n이로써 Gradient Descent 알고리즘이라는 첫번째 기계학습 알고리즘을 배웠다.      \n참고1: (a) -> (c) 편미분 풀이과정참고2: Linear regression에서는 cost function J의 최소점이 무조건 1개이다. 그래프의 모양은 bowl-shape이다. 이를  convex quadratic function 이라고 부름.    \n"},"documents/1.3-linear-algebra-review.html":{"url":"documents/1.3-linear-algebra-review.html","title":"1.3.

Note that for some programming languages, the arrays are 0-indexed.    \nMatrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase.    \n\"Scalar\" means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix.    \n\\mathbb{R}refers to the set of scalar real numbers.    \n\\mathbb{R^n}refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.    \n\nOctave/Matlab commands\n% The ; denotes we are going back to a new row.    \nA = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]    \n% Initialize a vector     \nv = [1;2;3]     \n\n% Get the dimension of the matrix A where m = rows and n = columns    \n[m,n] = size(A)    \n% You could also store it this way    \ndim_A = size(A)    \n% Get the dimension of the vector v     \ndim_v = size(v)    \n% Now lets index into the 2nd row 3rd column of matrix A    \nA_23 = A(2,3)\n\n1.3.2 Matrix addition and substriction and 스칼라곱\nIn scalar multiplication, we simply multiply every element by the scalar value:    \nIn scalar division, we simply divide every element by the scalar value:    \nOctave/Matlab commands\n% Initialize matrix A and B     \nA = [1, 2, 4; 5, 3, 2]    \nB = [1, 3, 4; 1, 1, 1]    \n% Initialize constant s     \ns = 2    \n\n% See how element-wise addition works    \nadd_AB = A + B     \n% See how element-wise subtraction works    \nsub_AB = A - B    \n% See how scalar multiplication works    \nmult_As = A * s    \n% Divide A by s    \ndiv_As = A / s    \n% What happens if we have a Matrix + scalar?    \nadd_As = A + s\n\n1.3.3.

Multivariate Linear Regression\n\n이번 챕터에서는 하나 이상의 variable 또는 하나 이상의 feature를 사용하는 보다 강력한 Linear regression에 대해 알아볼 것이다.     \n2.1.1. Multiple Features\n지금까지는 x (집 크기) 라는 하나의 feature만 사용했다. 이것을 집의 가격을 결정(예측)하는 요소로 사용했다.     \n그런데 집값을 결정짓는 요소는 집 크기하나 말고도 더 많을 수 있다. 이럴때 Linear regrresion을 어떻게 할수 있을까? 다음의 예시처럼 집의 크기와 방의 갯수, 층수, 연식 등등으로 고려해서 집값을 예측(결정) 할 수 있을 것이다.     \n    \n4개의 feature를 이용해 집값을 예측해 보자.     \n먼저 새로운 notation은 다음과 같이 정의한다.     \n    \n\n이 예시에서 4개의 feature가 있으므로 n = 4이다. (m은 테이블의 행의 갯수(training data의 갯수)임에 유의)    \n여기서 x^{(2)}는 두번째 training set(두번째 행)의 데이터를 가진 4차원 vector다.x^{(2)} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1416 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 40 \\end{bmatrix}다시말해 두번째 집의 가격을 결정짓는 요소들이다.추가로 아래첨자는 feature 번호다. 가령 x^{(2)}_3는 테이블에서 2를 가리킨다.     \n\nfeature가 늘어났으므로 Hypothesis function의 형태도 달라져야한다.     \n  \npreviously:\\\\    \n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x \\\\    \n  \nnew :\\\\    \n h_\\theta(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_2 + \\theta_3x_3 + \\theta_4x_4    \n  \n가령 이 예제에서 hypothesis function은 다음과 같을 수 있다.(\\theta_4 가 -2인 이유는 집이 오래될 수록 집값은 떨어지기 때문이다. )결국 h_\\theta(x) 에서 \\theta_j는 feature x_j에대한 가중치라고 볼수 있다.   \n  \n h_\\theta(x) = 80 + 0.1x_1 + 0.01x_2 + 3x_3 - 2x_4    \n  \n결국 n개의 feature가 있다면 가설함수는 아래와 같다.     \n    \nFeature 벡터 X와 parameter 벡터 \\theta가 있다.  결국 X는 n차원 벡터고 \\theta 도 만찬가지로 n차원 벡터다.이 두 벡터를 곱하면 h_\\theta(x) 가 된다!곱셈의 편의를 위해서 \\theta 벡터는 transpose 한다. (nx1, nx1 끼리는 곱셈불가하기 때문에  1xn * nx1 의 형태로 변경해야함)따라서 hypothesis function은  h_\\theta(x) = \\theta^TX  같이 간략히 표현된다!    \n  \n\\begin{align*}h_\\theta(x) =\\begin{bmatrix}\\theta_0 \\hspace{2em} \\theta_1 \\hspace{2em} ... \\hspace{2em} \\theta_n\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline \\vdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix}= \\theta^T x\\end{align*}    \n  \n이것을 Multivariate Linear regression 이라고 부른다    \n\n추측하기로는 결국 다변수 선형회귀도 궁극적으로 해결하려는 것은  training set의 데이터를 가지고 \\theta_n 들을 구하는것일 것이다. 그 \\theta 로 이루어진 h_\\theta()는  training set을 가장 유사하게 모사하는함수다.  여기서도 cost function J()를 새롭게 정의하게 될듯     \n\n2.1.2. Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables\n    \n\ncost function 자체는 동일하다.여기서 여러개의 parameter \\theta_0 ... \\theta_n 는 모두 간단하게 벡터 \\theta 로 바꿔서 표기할 수있다.      \n\nfeature가 1개 이상일때 Gradient Descent 알고리즘을 아래와같고 결국 각 \\theta 는 그 아래와같이 계산 될 수 있다. 개념상 이해하는데는 feature 가 1개일때랑 크게 차이가 없다.      \n    \n우리가 최종 계산할 parameter \\theta_0 ... \\theta_n 계산 공식!    \n  \n\\begin{align*} & \\text{repeat until convergence:} \\; \\lbrace \\newline \\; & \\theta_0 := \\theta_0 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_0^{(i)}\\newline \\; & \\theta_1 := \\theta_1 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_1^{(i)} \\newline \\; & \\theta_2 := \\theta_2 - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\cdot x_2^{(i)} \\newline & \\cdots \\newline \\rbrace \\end{align*}    \n  \n2.1.3. Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling\nFeature Scaling 이란?     \n만약 여러개의 feature가 비슷한 크기의 범위를 갖는 값이라면 Gradient Descent가 더 빠르게 수렴할 수 있다.  더 적은 수의 반복으로 목적지에 수렴이 가능하다.     \n가령 x_1 값이 0 ~ 2000 의 범위를 갖고 x_2는 1 ~ 5 의 범위를 갖는다고 가정하면 그 두개의 feature의 범위 차이가 매우 크기 때문에 왼쪽 처럼 등고선이 매우 길쭉하게 나타난다. 그러면 기울기 하강은 더 난해하고 복잡한 경로로 오랫동안 일어나게 된다. 만약 우측처럼 범위를 동일하게 맞춰주면 등고선의 모양은 거의 원형이라 더 빠르게 하강할 수 있다.     \n따라서 이렇게 각 feature의 scale을 비슷하게 조정할 필요가 있다. (정확하게 똑같이 맞출필요는없다. 대충 비슷하게만 맞으면 된다.)  이것이 이번장에서 다룰 Feature Scaling이다.     \n    \n\nFeature Scaling 기법중 하나는 Mean normalization이다. 이것은 x를 대략 -0.5 ~ 0.5 범위로 scale 시킨다. 방법은     \n\n  \nx_n := {x_n - \\mu_n \\over s_n}    \n  \n\n\\mu_1 은 x_1의 평균이다.s_1 은 보통 최대값-최소값으로 하면된다.     \n\n2.1.4. Gradient Descent in Practice II - Learning Rate\n이번 챕터에서는 learning rate \\alpha를 어떻게 정하는지 알아본다.     \nGradient Descent가 잘동작한다면 j()는 매 iteration마다 감소해야한다.     \n300 회 반복 부터는 cost function 이 거의 줄어들지 않고 수렴한다.Gradient Descent 가 수렴하는 iteration 횟수는? 경우에 따라 다양하기 때문에 사전에 알기 어렵다.     \nAutomatic Convergence Test라는 Gradient Descent 가 수렴하는지 안하는지 알려주는 test가 존재 하기도 한다.    \n만약 J 가 감소하지 않고 증가한다면 명백한 문제가 있는것이고, 더 작은 learning rate \\alpha 사용해야한다는 뜻이다.     \n적절한 learning rate \\alpha 알아서 찾아서 좋은 Gradient Descent를 구현해야한다. 특별히 정답은 없는듯.    \nTo summarize:    \n\nIf \\alphaα is too small: slow convergence.    \nIf \\alphaα is too large: ￼may not decrease on every iteration and thus may not converge.    \n\n2.1.5. Features and Polynomial Regression\n이번챕터 에서는 어떻게 Feature를 선택할지, 적절한 Feature의 선택으로 강력한 학습 알고리즘을 만드는 방법에대해 알아본다. Polynomial Regression(다항 회귀?)에 대해서도 알아본다.  Polynomial Regression은 linear regression 을이용해서 복잡한 비선형 함수에도 적용하는 것이다.     \n    \n이런경우는 굳이 x_2 까지 항을 늘려서 모델(가설함수)을 만들 필요가 없다.x_1을 넓이로 바로 사용해도 된다.     \n이런 형태의 training data가 존재한다고 하자.    \nhypothesis function이 h_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1  일 때, x1 에 연관된 feature를 추가하여 2차 함수꼴로 만들 수 있다.  \nh_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^2    \n여기서 \\theta_2 x_1^2 가 x_2^2 가 아니라 x_1^2 임을 유의하자. 결국 feature는 하나인것이다.하나의 feature를 가지고 제곱이나 제곱근등등으로 형태를 변경하여 함수모양을 바꿀수 있다. 이것은 결국 feature가 하나 더 늘어나는것과 같은 의미이다. 결국x_1 = x_1x_2 = (x_1)^2와 같다.     \n이차함수형태의 모델을 사용하면 나중에 감소하는 구간이 생기기에 적합하지 않다.이럴땐 3차 함수 형태를 사용하는게 더 적합하다.  \nh_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_1^3 + \\theta_3 x_1^3    \n이렇게 3차 함수꼴로 나타냈을때그리고 아래와 같이 제곱근 형태의 함수를 사용하는게 더 적합할 수도 있다.  \nh_\\theta (x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 \\sqrt{x_1}    \n  \n이러한 함수형태를 자동으로 찾아주는 알고리즘이 존재한다. 앞으로는 그것을 사용할것이다.     \n중요한것은 이렇게 feature 하나를 가지고 새로운 feature를 만들면 feature scaling이 중요해진다.x_1이 1~1000 범위를 갖는다면, 그로부터 만든 새 feature인 (x_1)^2는 1 ~ 1000000 의 범위를 갖게 될것이기 때문이다. 이 둘의 차이가 너무 크면 gradient descent 가 엄청 느려진다.     \n\nPolynomial feature  생성하는 방법:만약 training data의 feature가  x_1  x_2 이렇게 주어진다면, 그 두개의 feature 벡터를 가지고 다음의 polynomial feature 값을 모두 연산하여 새로운 matrix를 생성한다. 그리고 각 polynomial feature에 해당하는 가중치  \\theta 를 적절하게 선택(Gredient descent등 사용)하여, Polynomial한 h_\\theta(x) 함수를 생성할 수 있는것이다.  \nx_1 , x_2 , x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1x_2, x_1^3, x_1^2x_2, x_1x_2^2 , x_2^3, ....  \nTraining set을 가지고 그 데이터를 잘 모사하는 h_\\theta(x)를 만들때, 함수형태를 먼저 찾는것이 아니다. 모든 형태를 만든다음에  x 의 parameter (혹은 weight)  \\theta를 0으로 만들던지 하여 불필요한 항을 제거하는 방식으로 함수 형태를 찾는것이다.    \n\nPolynomial feature  생성 알고리즘(in Octave):연습문제 ex2_reg.m 의 mapFeature.m 참고  \n  X = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2));\n\n\nx_1, x_2a feature가 X벡터에 있을때  \n\n  function out = mapFeature(X1, X2)  \n\n  degree = 6;        % 몇차 polynomial feature까지 생성할 것인지  \n  out = ones(size(X1(:,1)));  \n  for i = 1:degree  \n      for j = 0:i  \n      out(:, end+1) = (X1.^(i-j)).*(X2.^j);  \n      end  \n  end  \n  end\n\n\n\n"},"documents/2.2-computing-parameters-analytically.html":{"url":"documents/2.2-computing-parameters-analytically.html","title":"2.2.

Computing Parameters Analytically\n\n2.2.1. Normal Equation\nNormal Equation은 최적의 \\theta 를 구할 수 있는 또다른 방법이다.  gradient descent 와는 다른 방식으로 각각 장/단점이 있다.     \nNormal Equation은 \\theta 를 반복계산 없이 공식하나로 한번에 구할 수 있다.다음의 training set을 보자.     \n    \n\n4개의 feature가 있고 결과가 있다. 이것을 각각 X matrix와 y 벡터로 복사한다. 계산의 편의를 위해  1을 갖는 x_0 열이 추가되었음에 유의. 이것을가지도 아래 Normal Equation 공식에 대입해 계산하면 바로 \\theta를 구할 수 있다!    \n\n  \n\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty    \n  \n이렇게 계산된 \\theta 는 cost function J를 최소화하는 값이다.     \n    \n만약 i번째 하나의 training data가 위의 x^{(i)} 처럼 n + 1 크기의 벡터로 주어진다면, 이것으로 우측과 같이 Design Matrix X를 만든다. (결국 이전 예시처럼 테이블을 그대로 matrix에 복사한것과 동일한 구성임)    \n더 간단한 예를들면 아래와 같다.    \n\\theta 를 구하는 Octave 명령어    \npinv(X'*X)*X'*y\n\n반복 계산도 필요없고 적절한 \\alpha를 찾아야하는 수고가 없다. 또한 Feature scaling도 필요없다. 이렇게 좋은 방법이 있다니?그러나 결론적으로Normal Equation에 매우 치명적인 단점이 있다. n(feature갯수)가 엄청 커지면 Normal Equation은 못쓴다. 복잡도가 O(n^3) 으로 연산속도가 엄청나게 느려지기 때문이다.     \nGradient descent 와 Normal equation을 비교하면 아래와 같다.    \n보통 n=10000 정도까지는 Normal equations을 사용해도 괜찮다고 한다. 현대 컴퓨팅 파워로 이정도계산 까지는 실용적인 속도를 얻을 수 있다.     \n2.2.2. Normal Equation Noninvertibility\n역행렬이 없는 Normal Equation은 어떻게 구해야할까?  \n\\theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty    \nX^TX 가 역행렬이 없는 경우가 있기 때문이다.     \n다음의 두가지 경우에 X^TX 에 역행렬이 없다.    \n\n1번은 각 feature가 x_1 = (3.28)^2x_2 처럼 선형적으로 종속적인 관계일때이다. 이럴땐 둘 중 한feature를 제거해도 된다.두번째는 피쳐갯수(n)이 training set갯수(m)보다 많을때이다. 이럴땐 어떤 feature들을 지우거나, regularization기법을 사용한다.      \n\n"},"documents/3-logistic-regression-regularization.html":{"url":"documents/3-logistic-regression-regularization.html","title":"3.

Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email as spam or not spam.  \n3.1.1. Classfication\n\n이번 챕터에서는 어떻게 Classfication 분류 알고리즘을 어떻게 개발할수 있는지 알아본다.우선 linear regression을 classification에 적용하는것은 가능해보이기는 하나. 데이터가 동떨어진 곳에 하나만 추가되어도 가설함수가 바뀌기 때문에 옳지 못한 결과를 만들어낼 수 있다.  \n따라서 y가 0또는 1인 binary classification problem 에 집중할것이다.   \n3.1.2. Logistic Regression\n\n(용어는 Regression 이지만 Classfication 문제임)  \nLogistic Regression 에서 아래와 같은 범위를 갖는 가설함수를 만들것이다.  \n0 \\leq h_\\theta(x) \\leq 1  \n  \n  \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta (x) = g ( \\theta^T x ) \\newline \\newline& z = \\theta^T x \\newline& g(z) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\\end{align*}  \n  \n그렇게 하기 위해서는 가설함수 h_\\theta(x)를 g(z) 형태로 변화시켜야한다. 그 이유는 0 \\leq h_\\theta(x) \\leq 1를 만족시키도록 만들기 위해서이다. 그래프로 그리면 시그모이드 함수의 형태로 나타나고 범위가 1이하 0이상을 만족한다. 이제 우리가할일은 \\theta 파라미터를 우리의 데이터에 맞게 맞추는것이다. 파라미터를 찾는 알고리즘은 후에 다시 살펴본다.   \n  \ng(z)의 결과는 항상 0 이상 1이하를 만족한다.  \nh(x)는 입력값 x에대해서 y가 1일 확률을 추청하는 함수이다.가령 위그림과 같이 x의 feature가 두개 즉 feature 벡터 x가 있을때. (하나는 1, 하나는 종양크기) 만약 가설함수가 0.7로 나왔다면, 결과를 이렇게 해석할 수 있다. y=1일 확률 즉 악성종양일 확률이 70%이라고.   \n이것을 수학적으로 더 엄밀하게 표현하면 아래와 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \\theta) = 1 - P(y=0 | x ; \\theta) \\newline&  \nP(y = 0 | x;\\theta) + P(y = 1 | x ; \\theta) = 1\\end{align*}  \n  \n\nh_\\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \\theta)  해석: Probability that y=1, given x, parameterized by \\thetay가 1일 가능성, 주어진 x, 즉 환자가 특징 x로 나타내지는 특정 종양의 크기를 가질때, 이것이 \\theta에 매개된 가능성이다.   \n\n3.1.3. Decision Boundary\n\nh(x)가 계산하는것이 정확히 무엇이냐? 가설함수가 예측하는 값이 언제 y=1이고 0인지 이해해보자.   \n  \n가령 h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 일때 y = 1이라고 가정한다면, h_\\theta(x) = g(\\theta^T x) \\geq 0.5  와 같다. 그래프를 보면 z \\geq 0일때 g(z) \\geq 0.5이므로 z = \\theta^Tx \\geq 0 일때 와 같다.   \n즉 \\theta^Tx \\geq 0 이면, y = 1 로 예측할 수 있다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\theta(x) \\geq 0.5 \\rightarrow y = 1 \\newline& h_\\theta(x)   \n  \n가령 h(x) 가 위처럼 g(\\theta^Tx) 형태일때, \\theta 벡터가  \\theta = \\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} 라고 가정하면, \\theta^Tx  가 0보다 큰 경우, 즉 y=1일 경우는 그래프가 나타태는 영역과 같다. x_1 x_2는 training set이다.  x_1 + x_2 \\geq 0 이 나타내는 영역이 y=1인것이다.  이때 h(x) = g(\\theta^Tx) \\geq 0.5를 만족한다.이 경계를 나타내는 함수를 Decision Boundary 라고 부른다!  \nThe decision boundary is the line that separates the area where y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function.  \n실제로(x_1, x_2)이 (1,1)과 (3,3)일때 h_\\theta(x)를 계산해보면 다음과 같다.   \n\n(3,3)일때 -> \\theta^Tx = 3  \n  octave:6> 1 / (1 + e^-(3))  \n  ans =  0.95257\n\n\n0.5보다 큼 -> y=1 일확률 95%  \n\n\n(1,1)일때 -> \\theta^Tx = -1  \n  octave:7> 1 / (1 + e^-(-1))  \n  ans =  0.26894\n\n\n0.5보다 작음 -> y=1 일 확률 27%  \n\n\n\n3.1.4. Non-linear Decision Boundary\n\n  \n일반적인 경우 logistic regression은 linear한 decision boundary 밖에 찾을 수 없다. (since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary)따라서 Decision Boundary가 non-linear한 경우의 예는 위와 같다. (\\theta^Tx) 는 feature 두개를(x_1 x_2) 가지고Polynomial 한 변수를 사용했음에 유의 (x_1^2 x_2^2)\\theta가 Decision Boundary 모양을 결정한다 training data가 하는게 아님.  \nPolynomial 한 feature를 더 복합적으로 사용하면 더 복잡한 모양의 Decision Boundary를 얻을 수 있다.   \n\n추측하기로 결국 이 3 장에서 할일은. training set x가 있을때 적절한 Decision Boundary함수 그래프 모형(?)을 선택하고 \\theta 를 구한다. 최적의 \\theta는 당연히도 cost function J(\\theta)를 최소화하는 값으로 구할것이다. 그렇게 해서 구해진 가설함수 h_\\theta(x)는 주어진 x가 y=1영역인지 아닌지를 판단해준다. 확률값으로.  \n3.1.5. Cost function\n\n이번 챕터에서는 어떻게 적절한 parameter \\theta를 구할수 있는지 알아본다.   \n  \n\nm개의 Training set이 위와같고,  feature 벡터 x 가 위와 같을때.  \\theta를 어떻게 선택할 수 있을까?  \n\nLogistic regression의 cost function 은 다음과 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& J(\\theta) = \\dfrac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(h_\\theta(x)) \\; & \\text{if y = 1} \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = -\\log(1-h_\\theta(x)) \\; & \\text{if y = 0}\\end{align*}  \n  \n\ny=1일때, y=0일때 다르다.   \n\nJ(\\theta)는 training examples의 모든 i에 대한 합이고 하나의 i에 해당하는 Cost(h_\\theta(x), y)는 예시는 아래와 같다.참고로 Linear regression에서 cost function은 \"실제값과 예측값의 차이\"였다. Logistic regression 에서는 log함수 형태를 선택했다. 예측값(y= 0또는 1)이 실제값(y= 0또는 1)과 가까우면 0이고 틀리면 무한대가 된다. 결국 개념상 예측값(h_\\theta(x), y=1일 확률값) 과 실제값(y)의 차이인것은 동일하다.  Logistic regression은 실제값 y가 0또는 1밖에 없기 때문에 cost func를 두개로 나눌수 있는것.   \n참고: m개의 training data가 필요한 시점은 언제부터 인가? 다시 말해 m개의 데이터를 통해 학습하는 단계는 언제부터인가?-> Cost function J(\\theta)를 계산하는 시점이다. J(\\theta)는 각 training set으로 부터 계산된 값을 모두 더해야하기 때문이다. 이 지점을 Learning 한다고 표현하는것 같다.   \n만약 y=1일때 cost function J(\\theta)는 아래와 같이 그릴 수 있다. x축인 h_\\theta(x) 의 범위는 0 에서 1사이이다.  \n반대로 y=0일때는 다음과 같다.  \n만약 y=1로 예측을 하는 cost 함수에서 h_\\theta(x) = 0 이 나오면 대단한 오류이기 때문에 cost즉 J(\\theta)가 무한대이다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) = 0 \\text{ if } h_\\theta(x) = y \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 0 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 1 \\newline & \\mathrm{Cost}(h_\\theta(x),y) \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{ if } y = 1 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; h_\\theta(x) \\rightarrow 0 \\newline \\end{align*}  \n  \n3.1.6. Simplified Cost Function and Gradient Descent\n\n\nCost Function  \n\ny=1일때와 0일때 경우로 나뉜 cost function은 아래와같이 하나의 식으로 합칠수 있다. y=1과 y=0을 대입해보면 동일하다.  \n그리고 J(\\theta)는 아래와 같은 공식으로 나타낼 수 있다.   \n  \n이것을 Vectorized 하면 아래와 같다. 실제 Octave로 계산할때는 아래의 식을 사용한다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*} & h = g(X\\theta)\\newline & J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{m} \\cdot \\left(-y^{T}\\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\\log(1-h)\\right) \\end{align*}  \n  \n\nGredient Descent 알고리즘.   \n\n\\theta_j 를 구하는 알고리즘도 아래와 같다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}& Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline & \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j}J(\\theta) \\newline & \\rbrace\\end{align*}  \n  \n편미분해서 도함수(Derivative)를 대입하면   \n  \n\\begin{align*} & Repeat \\; \\lbrace \\newline & \\; \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) x_j^{(i)} \\newline & \\rbrace \\end{align*}  \n  \n결국 Gredient Descent 알고리즘이 Linear regression과 완벽히 동일 하다!!(각 \\theta 값은 동시에(simultaniously) 계산되어야하는 것도 마찬가지)  \n  \n\nLinear regression 과 딱하나 차이가 있다면 h_\\theta(x) 의 형태이다.   \n\nLinear regressionh_\\theta(x) = \\theta^Tx    \nLogistic regressionh_\\theta(x) = {1 \\over (1 + e^{-\\theta^Tx})}  \n\n\n결국 Vectorized 하면  \\theta는 아래와 같이 구할 수 있다.    \n  \n3.1.7. Advanced Optimization\n\nFor logistic regression, sometimes gradient descent will converge to a local minimum (and fail to find the global minimum). This is the reason we prefer more advanced optimization algorithms such as fminunc (conjugate gradient/BFGS/L-BFGS/etc).  \nOctave 라이브러리 fminunc() 사용, theta vector를 Gradient descent보다 빨리 찾을 수 있음.https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/cmjIc/advanced-optimization  \n3.1.8.

Overfitting problem\n\n3.2.1. Overfitting 이란?\n  \nFeature를 많이 둘 수록 Training data을 더 정확히 모사할 수 있다.  하지만 가설함수가 너무 Training data에만 적합해서 Training data는 거의 정확하게 예측하지만 새로 들어온 데이터에 대해서는 예측을 못하는 문제가 발생할수 있다.  해당 가설함수로 문제를 일반화(generalize)하는것을 실패함.그림맨 왼쪽은 Underfit (high bias, preconception 이라고도 표현할수 있음), 오른쪽이 Overfit, 가운데가 적합함.  \n강의 뒷편에서 학습알고리즘이 Overfitting인지 아닌지 분석하는 툴에대해 살펴볼 것이다.   \nFeature가 너무 많을때 Overfitting이 발생할 수 있다. 해결책은 크게 두가지이다.   \n\n1) Reduce the number of features:  \n\nManually select which features to keep.  \nUse a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).  \n\n\n2) Regularization  \n\nKeep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters \\theta_jθ   \nRegularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.이번 장에서 다룰 내용  \n\n\n\n3.2.2. Cost function\n  \nRegularization 은 이렇게 cost function 에 특정\\theta_j에 큰 가중치를 부여(패널티 부여)해서 최종적으로 \\theta_j 의 크기를 0에 가깝게 만드는것이다. 이렇게하면 4차 함수를 쓰더라도 2차함수 모델에 근접하게 만들 수 있다.   \n  \n그렇다면 어떤 \\theta_i를 선택해서 Regularization할 것인가? 우리는 어떤게 맞는지 알수없다. 그래서  다음의 공식으로 모든 parameter  \\theta_i에 대해서 값을 줄여(shrink)서 cost function값을 확인해 보는 것이다.  J(\\theta) 의 공식에 \\color{royalblue}{+ \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2} 부분이 추가된다.   \nIn regularized linear regression, we choose \\theta to minimize:   \n\nJ(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( h_\\theta( x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \\right)^2 \\color{royalblue}{+ \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2} \n\nThe \\lambda is the regularization parameter. It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated.  \n어떤 \\lambda를 적용 했을때, 모든 \\theta에대해서 가장 cost function이 작아지는지 확인?  \n어떤 feature에 대한 parameter \\theta_j 가 있을때 그 파라미터에대해서  J(\\theta)를 구해보면, 왼쪽항은 줄어들지만, 람다항 + \\lambda \\sum_{i= 1}^{100} \\theta_j^2은 커진다. 이 둘의 조합을 통해 결국 가장 작은 값을 갖는 \\theta_j 를 찾으면 overfitting을 방지한 \\theta값을 찾을 수 있을 것이다.   \n\\lambda 가 또 너무 커도 Underfitting이 발생할 수도 있음에 주의해야 한다.  \n3.2.3. Regularized Linear Regression\nOverfitting 을 피하기 위해서 Linear Regression 에서 Regularized하는 방법에 대해 알아보자.   \nRegularized 를 Gradient descent 알고리즘에 적용하면 다음과 같다. \\theta_0인 경우는 seperated 되었다는점에 주의 (어차피 1이기 때문이다.)  \n  \n\n분홍색 부분은 J(\\theta)를 편미분한 도함수이다. 증명은 생략한다.   \n\n\\theta_j 항을 모아서 쓰면 다음과 같다.  \n1 - \\alpha {\\lambda \\over m} 항(term)은 흥미로운 영향을 준다.  1 - \\alpha {\\lambda \\over m}  이다. 그리고  \\theta_j 자체를 약간 줄인다. 그 우측 항은 기존 gradient descent 와 동일하다.   \nNormal Equation 은 어떻게 적용할 수있는지 살펴보자.간단하다 공식은 아래와 같다. L matrix 크기는  (n+1) x (n+1) 이다.

Neuron model: Logistic Unit\n\n  \n뉴런 세포는 input(수상돌기, dendrites)과 output(축삭돌기, axon)이 있으며 이것을 위와 같이 수학적 모델로 나타낼 수 있다.  x_1,x_2,x_3는 input wire로 연결되어있고 가운데 원은 세포라고 볼수 있다. 그리고  h_\\theta(x) 로 향하는것이 output wire이다.  h_\\theta(x) 는 Logistic regression의 가설함수와 마찬가지로, Sigmoid 함수 g(x)의 형태를 띈다. 그리고 feature  x와  \\theta 벡터가 있다.  \\theta는 Weight(가중치)라고 표현한다. 우리가 지금까지 Parameter라고 불렀던것과 동일하다.  x_0는 bias unit이라고 표현하며 항상 1의 값을 가지므로 굳이 나타내지 않아도 된다.이것이 하나의 뉴런을 나타낸 다이어그램이다.   \n\nNN 에서 a_i^j 의 의미는 무엇인가?동일한 feature에 i마다 서로다른 가중치를 곱해 만들어진 Decision boundary 기준으로 어떤 side에 위치해 있는지 0, 1로 (혹은 확률값)으로 결과를 주는 함수 g(z). 위 그림에서 a_1^{(2)} 는 하나의 기준 (\\theta_1^{(1)})을 가지고 정한 하나의 \"분류\"   a_2^{(2)} 도 마찬가지로 또다른 기준을 적용한 분류이다. 모두 동일한 feature에 서로다른 기준(가중치)를 반영해 만들어진것이다.하나의 logistic regression은 하나의 decision boundary를 가지고 있다. 하나의 logistic regression 의 hypothesis인 a_i^j 는 고유의 decision boundary를 가지고 있는것이고, 결국 NN에서는 층(layer)별로 가지고 있는 desicion boundary들을 기준으로 추상화 시켜서 또다른 desicion boundary 를 생성시키는 것이다. 한마디로 층별로 새로운 desicion boundary 를 생성하는 것과 같다. 그리고 최종 desicion boundary는 최종 class 갯수만큼 나올것.   \n\n4.4. Neural Network\n\n그렇다면 여러개의 뉴런은 어떻게 표현할까?  \n  \nLayer 1은 input layer, Layer3은 output layer라고 부른다. input과 output이 아닌 layer는 Hidden Layer라고 부른다. 위 예제에서는 히든 레이어는 1개이나 두개가 될 수도 있다.    \n이것을 수학적 정의로 나타내보자.   \n  \nHidden Layer의 node를 a_i^{(j)} 라고 표현하고 Activation unit이라고 부른다. 윗첨자 (j)는 layer 번호이고, 아래첨자 i는 feature번호라고 볼수있다. a_i^{(2)} 은 두번째 layer의 activation node이고, a_i^{(3)} 은 세번째 layer의 activation node이다. 각 a_i^{(j)} node가 갖는 \\Theta_{ab}^{(j)}(weight)는 feature 별로(행 별로) 다를 수 있다. 참고로 각 activation node의 값은 sigmoid함수로 계산되기 때문에 0에서 1의 range를 갖는다.\\Theta_{ab}^{(j)} 에서 아래첨자 a,b는 \\Theta^{(j)} matrix의 행과 열을 의미한다. 크기가 a \\times b 인 matrix. 그리고 j번째 layer의 b번째 유닛에서 j+1번째 layer의 a번째 유닛으로 향하는 가중치를 의미한다.  (참고로 윗첨자 아래첨자 기준은 표기 하는 사람 마다 기준이 다른것같다.)  \n\\Theta^{(j)}는 각 feature에 따른 weight가 기록된 matrix이다. 크기를 구하는방법은 아래에서 다시 설명한다. 수학으로 표현하면 \\Theta^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R^{3\\times4}}참고: \\mathbb{R^n} : refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.    \nLayer1의 x 와  \\Theta^{(1)}를 가지고 layer2의 a_i^{(2)}를 생성하고Layer2의 a_i^{(2)} 와  \\Theta^{(2)}를 가지고 layer3의 a_i^{(3)}를 생성한다....  \n결국 최종적으로  h_\\Theta(x) 는 a_1^{(3)}이 되고  g(\\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \\Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \\Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \\Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)})  으로 계산된다.  h_\\Theta(x) 의 \\Theta는 대문자임에 유의 regression에서의 가설함수와 다르다.  \n이 과정을 간략하게 벡터로 표기하면  \n\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline x_3\\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\newline a_2^{(2)} \\newline a_3^{(2)} \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow h_\\theta(x)  \n  \n아래에서  \\theta matrix의 크기는 몇\\times몇 일까?만약 하나의 네트워크에서 layerj 의 유닛 갯수가 s_j , layerj+1의 유닛 갯수가 s_{j+1}개라면 matrix \\Theta^{(j)}의 크기는 다음과 같이 구할 수 있다.  \ns_{j+1} \\times (s_j + 1)  \n따라서, 위의 도식에서 \\Theta^{(1)} 의 크기는 4 \\times 3 이다.  \n4.5. Forward propagation: Vectored Implementation\n\n이것을 Forward propagation 이라고 한다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_2^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline a_3^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline h_\\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \\Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \\Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \\Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\newline \\end{align*}  \n  \n이것을 수학적으로 더 간단히 표현해보자.g()가 계산하는 항을 간단히 z_i^{(j)}라고 표현해보자.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}a_1^{(2)} = g(z_1^{(2)}) \\newline a_2^{(2)} = g(z_2^{(2)}) \\newline a_3^{(2)} = g(z_3^{(2)}) \\newline \\end{align*}  \n  \n즉 z를 일반화하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \nz_k^{\\color{red}(2)} =   \n\\Theta_{k,0}^{\\color{red}(1)}x_0 +  \n\\Theta_{k,1}^{\\color{red}(1)}x_1 + ... +  \n\\Theta_{k,n}^{\\color{red}(1)}x_n   \n  \n그리고 이것은 많이 보았던 형태로, 다음 벡터의 곱으로 표현될 수 있다!  \n\\begin{align*}x = \\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline\\cdots \\newline x_n\\end{bmatrix} &z^{(j)} = \\begin{bmatrix}z_1^{(j)} \\newline z_2^{(j)} \\newline\\cdots \\newline z_n^{(j)}\\end{bmatrix}\\end{align*}  \n  \n4.6. Neural Network Learning its Own Features\n\n  \n\n만약 Layer1을 가린다면 계산은 Logistic regression과 동일하다.   \n\n그리고 흥미로운 점은 node a1, a2, a3은 그들 스스로 input node들로부터 학습한 결과라는 점이다.  (And the cool thing about this, is that the features a1, a2, a3, they themselves are learned as functions of the input. )  \n반면 NN이 Logistic regression보다 뛰어난점은 Logistic regression에서 처럼 Layer 1의 x_1, x_2, x_3 feature에 제약조건을 걸지 않더라도, 새로운 그것만의 feature a_1, a_2, a_3를 만들(학습시킬)수 있다. x_1x_2 같은 polynomial feature를 생성하지 않고도 말이다. 그래서 결국 더 나은 hypothesis 를 사용할 수 있게 된다.   \nLogistic regression에서는 각 feature x_i에 해당하는 가중치  \\theta를 어떻게 정하느냐에 따라서, 그리고 training data들을 더 잘 모사하는 가설함수를 만들기 위해 어떤 polynomial feature를 추가하느냐에 따라서, 예측결과의 정확도가 높아지는데, 그것은 어렵고 연산량만 많아진다.Neural network는 이런 까다로운 작업 필요없이 각 layer단계에서 적절한  \\Theta matrix(가중치)를 선택하여 layer 단계별로 더 유용하게 추상화하여 결국 최종 예측을 더 정확하게 한다는 의미인듯하다.   \n4.7. Examples\n\nOR function\nSigmoid 함수의 결과는 0과 1이 될 수 있다.  NN을 통해 0과 1을 다루는 디지털 논리게이트를 모델링 할 수 있다.   \n  \n\nz = 4.6 이상이면 1에 가깝고,z = -4.6 이하면 0에 가깝다.   \n\n  \n\n가중치(weight)는 화살표에 나타내면 좀 더 직관적이다.   \n\n이것을 수학적으로 표현하면  \n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}g(z^{(2)})\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow h_\\Theta(x)\\end{align*}  \n  \n그리고 아래와 같은 결과가 도출되어 OR에 해당하는 진리표와 결과가 같다.  \n\\begin{align*}& h_\\Theta(x) = g(-30 + 20x_1 + 20x_2) \\newline \\newline & x_1 = 0 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 0 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-30) \\approx 0 \\newline & x_1 = 0 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 1 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-10) \\approx 0 \\newline & x_1 = 1 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 0 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(-10) \\approx 0 \\newline & x_1 = 1 \\ \\ and \\ \\ x_2 = 1 \\ \\ then \\ \\ g(10) \\approx 1\\end{align*}  \n  \nThe others\n아래와 같은 parameter로 OR 뿐만아니라, AND, NOR도 가능.  \n  \n\\begin{align*}AND:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &=\\begin{bmatrix}-30 & 20 & 20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline NOR:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &= \\begin{bmatrix}10 & -20 & -20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline OR:\\newline\\Theta^{(1)} &= \\begin{bmatrix}-10 & 20 & 20\\end{bmatrix} \\newline\\end{align*}  \n  \n아래의 모델로 (NOT x_1) AND (NOT x_2)의 형태도 구현이 가능하다.  \n\nXNOR  \n\n두개의 Layer를 두면 더 복잡한 논리게이트 연산도 가능하다.   \n  \n\\begin{align*}\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\newline a_2^{(2)} \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a^{(3)}\\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow h_\\Theta(x)\\end{align*}  \n  \n\\Theta^{(1)} matrix에서(즉, layer1에서) AND와 OR를 사용하고   \n  \n\\Theta^{(1)} =\\begin{bmatrix}-30 & 20 & 20 \\newline 10 & -20 & -20\\end{bmatrix}  \n  \n\\Theta^{(2)} matrix에서(layer2에서)OR를 사용하면   \n  \n\\Theta^{(2)} =\\begin{bmatrix}10 & -20 & -20\\end{bmatrix}  \n  \n아래와 같은 진리표를 얻을 수 있다!  \n  \nMulticlass Classification\nNN을 통해 하나 이상의 Category로 구분할 수도 있다.    \n다음은 NN을 이용해 수기로 쓴 번호를 인식한 것이다. 이것도 0부터 9까지 10개의 기호를 분류하는 Multiclass Classification 이다.    \n  \n\nby Yann LeCun  \n\n가운데 보이는 9는 input layer이다. 왼쪽에 보이는 것이 보다 추상화 시킨 Hidden layer 1 그리고 그 다음단계 Hidden layer2, 그 다음단계 Hidden layer3 이된다. 그리고 최종 output은 answer: 9 이다. (이것은 마치 대상에서 점차 의미를 제거하는것과 동일하다. 단계별 추상화의 최종 결과물에는 모든 의미가 사라지고 기호만이 남는다. 이것이 뇌의 근본 동작원리라면, 인간의 결국 뇌는 의미 제거장치인 것이다. 참고: 인포메이션, 제임스 글릭)  \n  \n만약 4개의 사진을 분류한다고 하면, 여러 layer를 거쳐 나온 최종 결과물은 4개의 4 \\times 1 벡터 이다.  \n최종 결과는 y 벡터로 표현가능하다.   \n"},"documents/ex3-1-multi-class-classification.html":{"url":"documents/ex3-1-multi-class-classification.html","title":"ex3.1 Multi-class classification","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\n\nex3-1 Multi-class classification\n\nlrCostFunction.m\nfunction [J, grad] = lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, lambda)  \n...(중략)  \n\nhx = X * theta;  \ngx = sigmoid(hx);  \n\n% Cost function J  \npos = -y' * log(gx);  \nneg = (1 - y)' * log(1 - gx);  \nregular = lambda / (2 * m) * sum(theta(2:end) .^ 2);  \n\nJ = (1 / m) * (pos - neg) + regular;  \n\n% Gradient descent  \n\ngrad = (1/m) * X' * (gx - y) + (lambda/m) .* theta;  \ngrad(1) = (1/m) * X(:,1)' * (gx - y);\n\noneVsAll.m\n\nfunction [all_theta] = oneVsAll(X, y, num_labels, lambda)  \n...(중략)  \n\nfor c = 1:num_labels  \n    initial_theta = zeros(n + 1, 1);  \n\n    % Set options for fminunc  \n    options = optimset('GradObj', 'on', 'MaxIter', 50);  \n\n    % Run fmincg to obtain the optimal theta  \n    % This function will return theta and the cost   \n    [theta] = ...  \n        fmincg (@(t)(lrCostFunction(t, X, (y == c), lambda)), ...  \n            initial_theta, options);  \n\n    all_theta(c,:) = theta';  \nend\n\n\n' 위에서 만든 lrCostFunction 을 가지고 num_labels 갯수만큼 반복한다. fmincg는 최적의 parameter \\Theta를 찾아줄것이고 1x401 크기의 결과(\\Theta)를 줄 것이다. feature가 401개 였기 때문에 그에 상응하는 parameter(weight)의 갯수도 401개. 결과는 단지 all_theta에 반복 횟수만큼 row가 추가되는것. 이 결과 all_theta를 가지고 predict 할것이다.    \n\npredictOneVsAll.m\nfunction p = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)  \n...(중략)  \n\ngx = sigmoid(X * all_theta');  \n[max_pobability_one_example, class_in_one_example] = max(gx, [], 2);  \np = class_in_one_example;\n\nX : 5000 X 401all_theta : 10 X 401gx : 5000 X 10matrix gx의 각 row의 의미: 한 training set의 가설함수 h_\\theta(x) 의 결과가 0~9 순서로 10개 저장되어있다. 해당 training set이  0~9 숫자일확률이 각각 들어있다.max(gx, [], 2); 를 하면 첫번째 결과물은 해당 row의 max 값이고 두번째는 그 max값의 index를 리턴한다. 그게 최종 우리의 예측 값.   \n"},"documents/ex3-2-neural-networks.html":{"url":"documents/ex3-2-neural-networks.html","title":"ex3.2 Neural Networks","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\nex3-2 Neural Networks\n\npredict.m\n\n% Add ones to the X data matrix  \nX = [ones(m, 1) X];  \na2 = sigmoid(X * Theta1');  \n\n% Add ones to the a2 data matrix  \na2 = [ones(m, 1) a2];  \na3 = sigmoid(a2 * Theta2');  \n\n[max_pobability_one_example, class_in_one_example] = max(a3, [], 2);  \np = class_in_one_example;\n\nLayer가 3개인 NN은 Logistic regression을 단계별로 두번 하는것과 동일하다.그렇게 해서 구해진 a3 벡터는  h_\\Theta(x) 벡터이다.X : 5000 x (400+1) (1 열 추가함)Theta1 : 25 x 401a2 : 5000 x (25+1) (1 열 추가함)Theta2 : 10 x 26a3 : 5000 x 10즉 predictOneVsAll.m 경우처럼 한 row의 크기가 10이고 각각에는 0~9 에 해당하는 확률값이 들어있다.     \n"},"documents/5-neural-networks-learning.html":{"url":"documents/5-neural-networks-learning.html","title":"5.

Backpropagation Algorithm\n\n머신러닝은  cost function J()에 대한 미분을 계산해야한다. Backpropagation는 이 미분을 효율적으로 계산하는 방법이다.  늘 그랫듯이, parameter \\theta를 학습하기 위해, cost function J()를 최소화해야 하는데 Backpropagation 이 그것을 위한 방법이다.   \nInput layer에서 출발해서 output을 구하는 forward propagation과는 반대로, BP는 output layer에서 시작한다. 즉, 마지막 결과의 'error'를 먼저 구하고, 해당 error 값을 이용해 각각의 node에서의 error 를 계산한다.(https://wikidocs.net/4262)  \n  \n결국 계산해야할 값은 cost function J()와 J()의 미분도함수(gradient)이다.   \n이전에 보았듯이 Forword propagation은 아래와 같이 계산된다.   \n  \nBP의 에러값 \\delta는 다음의 그림을 보면 직관적이다. 최종 결과물의 오차는 단순하다.

Layer가 4개인 경우, \\delta^{(4)} 는 단순하게 a(4) 에서 label y 를 뺀값이나, 다음 \\delta^{(3)} 부터는 가중치(\\Theta)를 고려해서 계산된다. \\delta^{(l)} = ((\\Theta^{(l)})^{T} \\delta^{(l+1)}) .* g'(z^{(l)}) g'(z^{(3)}) 은 미분도함수로  g'(z^{(l)}) = a^{(l)}.*(1 - a^{(l)}) 과 같이 계산된다.   \\delta^{(1)} 는 계산하지 않는다.'   \n  \n최종적으로 위의 계산을 마치면, 만약 \\lambda = 0 일때, 아래와 같은 결과가 나옴을 증명할 수 있다(고 한다).   \n  \n\\dfrac{\\partial }{\\partial \\Theta_{i,j}^{(l)}}J(\\Theta) = a_j^{(l)}\\delta_i^{(l+1)}  \n  \n이것을 계산하는 BP 알고리즘은 아래와 같다. 이것은결국 cost function J()의 미분도함수를 계산 하는 과정이다.    \n  \n\\Delta 는 a_j^{(l)}\\delta_i^{(l+1)} 를 누적해서 더한것을 의미한다. (그래서 0으로 초기화해서 시작)순서대로 살펴보면 먼저 Forward propagation 을 하여  a^{(l)} 계산을 마친다.그 뒤에 back propagation으로  각 \\delta 를 구한다.그리고 그 두항을 곱해서 \\Delta에 누적해서 더한다. (j = 0) 이 아닐때는 regularization \\lambda 항이 추가됨에 유의 j = 0일때는 bias 항이기 때문에 필요없음.그렇게 해서 나온 결과를 D_{ij}^{(l)} 라고 표현할 것이다.D_{ij}^{(l)} 가 결국 cost function J() 의 미분도함수가 되는것이다.    \n  \nD_{i,j}^{(l)} = \\dfrac{\\partial J(\\Theta)}{\\partial \\Theta_{i,j}^{(l)}}  \n  \nBP 이해 추천 사이트:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5Uhttp://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html  \n5.3.

Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters\n결국 NN 에서는 아래의 matrix를 이용하게 된다.  \\theta는 weitght, D 는 cost function J()의 미분 도계수를 의미한다.  \n\\begin{align*} \\Theta^{(1)}, \\Theta^{(2)}, \\Theta^{(3)}, \\dots \\newline D^{(1)}, D^{(2)}, D^{(3)}, \\dots \\end{align*}  \n  \n  \nfminunc() 등을 사용해 optimizing 하기 위해서 아래와 같이 각 matrix를 하나의 벡터로 합친다(unroll)  \nthetaVector = [ Theta1(:); Theta2(:); Theta3(:); ]  \ndeltaVector = [ D1(:); D2(:); D3(:) ]\n\n각 matrix는 아래와 같은 명령으로 다시 분리할 수 있다.   \nTheta1 = reshape(thetaVector(1:110),10,11)  \nTheta2 = reshape(thetaVector(111:220),10,11)  \nTheta3 = reshape(thetaVector(221:231),1,11)\n\n예를들어 3개의 레이어가 있고 각 unit의 갯수가 다음과 같다고 할때 아래와 같이 나타낼 수 있다.   \n  \n결국 이전 챕터에서 살펴 보았던 BP알고리즘을 더욱 간단히 도식화 하면 다음과 같다.fminunc() 의 parameter인 @costFunction이 cost J(\\Theta)와 그의 미분계수 D를 구하는 함수다.   \n  \n5.4.2. Gradient Checking\nBP에 문제가 없는지 확인할 수있는 방법이다. 항상 사용됨.   \n  \n\\Theta가 하나일때 2\\epsilon 만큼 떨어진 두 지점의 기울기를 이용하면 J() 의 미분계수를 추정할 수 있을것이다. 그리고 Octave에서 다음과 같이 implement 된다.   \ngradAppros = (J(theta + EPSILON) - J(theta - EPSILON)) / (2*EPSILON)\n\n멀티 parameter인 경우로 보다 일반화하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n그리고 Octave에서 다음과 같이 implement 된다.   \nepsilon = 1e-4;  \nfor i = 1:n,  \n  thetaPlus = theta;  \n  thetaPlus(i) += epsilon;  \n  thetaMinus = theta;  \n  thetaMinus(i) -= epsilon;  \n  gradApprox(i) = (J(thetaPlus) - J(thetaMinus))/(2*epsilon)  \nend;\n\n그리고 Gradient Checking으로 계산된 gradApprox(i)과 BP로 계산된 미분계수 D벡터가 같은지 확인하면 되는것이다.   \ngradApprox(i) = DVec   \n따라서 Gradient Checking을 사용하는 방법을 정리하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n다시 Training하기 전에 Gradient Checking을 끄지 않으면 엄청 느려질 수 있음에 주의해야한다.Once you have verified once that your backpropagation algorithm is correct, you don`t need to compute gradApprox again. The code to compute gradApprox can be very slow.  \n5.4.3. Random Initialization\n기존처럼 \\Theta 의 초기값을 0으로 정하는것은 NN에서 동작하지 않는다. 그이유는 잘 이해하지 못했음.  따라서 다음과 같이 \\Theta의 초기값을 구한다. 결과적으로 \\Theta 의 범위는 -\\epsilon ~ \\epsilon 이 될 것이다.   \n  \nOctave로 implement 하면:  \nIf the dimensions of Theta1 is 10x11, Theta2 is 10x11 and Theta3 is 1x11.  \n\nTheta1 = rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;  \nTheta2 = rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;  \nTheta3 = rand(1,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;\n\n\nrand(x,y) is just a function in octave that will initialize a matrix of random real numbers between 0 and 1.  \n\n5.4.4. Putting it Together\n지금까지 NN에서 다룬 내용을 모두 종합해보자.   \n첫번째로 적절한 Network architecture를 선택한다. 그것은 다음을 선택하는것이다.    \n\nInput Unit 갯수  \nOutput Unit 갯수  \nlayer 당 hidden unit 갯수 (많을수록 성능 향상, 연산 cost 증가)  \n\nTraining a Neural Network  \n\nRandomly initialize the weights  \nImplement forward propagation to get h_\\Theta(x^{(i)})  \nImplement the cost function  \nImplement backpropagation to compute partial derivatives4번까지 정리하면 이런 모양  \n\nUse gradient checking to confirm that your backpropagation works. Then disable gradient checking.  \n\nUse gradient descent or a built-in optimization function to minimize the cost function with the weights in theta.  \n\n최고점은 h_\\theta(x)^{(i)} 가 실제 값 y^{(i)} 와 가장 차이가 큰 것이고, 최저점은  h_\\theta(x)^{(i)} 가 실제 값 y^{(i)} 에 가장 가깝다는 뜻이다.gradient descent는 기울기를 하강하는 것이고, BP는 기울기를 하강할때 방향을 설정하는것과 같다.   \n"},"documents/ex4-1-neural-networks.html":{"url":"documents/ex4-1-neural-networks.html","title":"ex4.1 : neural networks","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\nex4-1 : neural networks\n\n1. feedforward and cost function (without regularization)\n\nnnCostFunction.m  \n\n\nfunction [J grad] = nnCostFunction(nn_params, ...  \n                                   input_layer_size, ...  \n                                   hidden_layer_size, ...  \n                                   num_labels, ...  \n                                   X, y, lambda)  \n\nTheta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...  \n                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));  \n\nTheta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...  \n                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));  \n\n% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================  \n% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the  \n%               following parts.  \n%  \n% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the  \n%         variable J.

Advice for Applying Machine Learning\n  \n만약 housing price 문제를 ML로 해결한다고 할때, 성능 개선을 위해서 위와같은 전략들을 시도해볼 수 있을것이다.그러나 이 방법들을 무작정 시도하기보다는 체계적으로 사용하는것이 효율적일 것이다. 6장에서는 다음 두가지로 어떻게 체계적으로 사용할수 있는지 알아본다.   \n\nhow to evaluate learning algorithm  \nML diagnostic  \n\n6.1. Evaluating a Hypothesis\n\n이번챕터에서는 Hypothesis 에대해서 평가하는 방법과, underfitting, overfitting을 피할 수 있는 방법에 대해서 알아본다.   \n70%를 training example, 30% 를 test example로 나눠서 cost function을 계산해본다.overfitting 인경우는 training error(cost) J(\\Theta) 는 매우 낮고, test error J_{test}(\\Theta) 는 클 것이다.  \n순서는 다음과 같다.   \n\nTraining/ testing procedure for linear regression  \nLearn parameter θ from training data (min. training error J(\\Theta))  \nCompute test set error J_{test}(\\Theta)   \n\n\n\nThe test set error:  \n6.2. Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets\n\n  \ntraining example에서 적합한 모델 d=5 를 골랐지만 이게 정말  generalize (다른문제도 정확히 예측)할 수 있는것인지 어떻게 알수 있을까?따라서 주어진 데이터를 단순히 training/test로만 나눌것이 아니라, d를 fit하기 위한 set역시 만들어야한다.   \n이렇게 3개로 나눈다. 계산은 다음과같이 한다.   \n  \n방법은,   \n\n10 차원 polinormial 모델들에서 각 min J(\\theta)를 통해  \\Theta 를 구한다.   \n해당 \\Theta 를 가지고 먼저  J_{CV}(\\Theta) 를 구해보는것이다.만약 그렇게 계산했더니 4차원 poli모델이 가장 낮은값이 나왔을때, J_{CV}(\\Theta^{(4)})  \n해당 모델을 가지고 J_{test}(\\Theta^{(4)})를 구해본다. 다시 말해 다른 traning set에 계산을 해보는것이다.    \n\n6.3.Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance\n\n\npolinormial 차원수 d에 따라서  \n\nlearning알고리즘을 돌릴때, 원하는대로 동작하지 않는다면 거의 대부분 high Bias문제 또는 high Variance 문제이다. 다시말해 underfitting 문제, 또는 overfitting 문제라는 말이다.이 것을 어떻게 구분할 수 있는지 알아보자.   \n  \n\nd 는 polinormial degree(차원)을 의미한다.   \n\ntraining examples 내 에서 구한 train error J_{train}(\\Theta) 는 d 가 많아질수록 에러율이 낮아진다. 반면 그럴수록 다른 data set example로 구분해놓은 Cross validation Set (CV) 에서는 해당 모델로는 더욱 맞지 않게 된다. 해당 모델은 training example에서만 정확히 모사되기 때문이다(Overfit). 그래프로 표현하면 위와 같다. 따라서,  \nUnderfit(High Bias)일 경우는 Cost(or error) J_{train}(\\Theta)가 값이 크고 J_{CV}(\\Theta) 또한 값이 크다. 그리고 그 둘값이 비슷하다.Overfit(High Variance) 인경우는 J_{train}(\\Theta)이 매우 낮고,  J_{CV}(\\Theta) 값이 상대적으로 크다.   \n\nHigh bias (underfitting): both J_{train}(\\Theta)J and J_{CV}(\\Theta)J  will be high. Also, J_{CV}(\\Theta) \\approx J_{train}(\\Theta)   \n\nHigh variance (overfitting): J_{train}(\\Theta)  will be low and J_{CV}(\\Theta) will be much greater than J_{train}(\\Theta)  \n\n\n  \n6.4. Regularization and Bias/Variance\n\n\n\\lambda 크기에 따라서   \n\nLinear regression 의  regularization 하는 경우에 대해서도 알아보자.   \n  \n\n\\lambda 크기에 따라서 bias 가 될 수 있고, variance가 될 수 있다.   \n\n그렇다면 어떻게 적절한 \\lambda를 선택할 수 있을까?  \n  \n먼저 \\lambda 는 0부터 0.01 을 제곱해서 늘려가며 12번 try한다.그렇게  각 min J(\\theta)를 통해  \\Theta 를 구한다.   \n\n해당 \\Theta 를 가지고 먼저  J_{CV}(\\Theta) 를 구해본다.만약 그렇게 계산했더니 5번째 \\lambda 를 사용한 regularized model이 가장 낮은값이 나왔을때, J_{CV}(\\Theta^{(5)})  \n해당 모델을 가지고 J_{test}(\\Theta^{(5)})를 구해본다.   \n\n(위의 방법과 매우 유사)  \n  \n\\lambda 가 작으면  J(\\theta)도 작아짐에 유의  \n6.5. Learning Curves\n\n\nTraining Example 수 m 에 따라서  \n\n일반적으로 m이 적을때는 J_{train}(\\Theta) 는 training examples를 정확히 모사한다. 극단적으로 m=1,2,3일때 타원의 곡선은 3점을 지나기 때문에 cost가 0이다. 반면 이 모델로 cross validate set 데이터에 적용해봤을때는 오차가 발생한다.   \n\nHigh bias (underfit)  \n\n우측상단 공식처럼 high bias인 hypothesis (직선,linear) 가 있을때, m이 작으면 cv set을 더 정확히 표현할 수 없다. (파란색 그래프) 그리고 m 이 더 늘어난다고 하더라도, 절대적 J_{CV}(\\Theta) 크기는 크게 떨어지지 않는다. 금방 flattened 되어버린다.  \nJ_{train}(\\Theta) 은 m이 적을때 무척 낮다가 사이즈가 커질수록 높아지는데 금방 Cross validation error 값에 수렴한다. 이유는 적은 수의 파라미터로  많은 양의 데이터를 표현하기에는 한계가 크기 때문이다.  \n또한 흥미로운점은, 러닝 알고리즘이 high bias(underfit) 인 경우에는 더 많은 training data를 모아봤자, 별 도움이 안된다는 것이다. 왜냐하면 그래프에서 볼 수 있듯이, m 이늘어나도 J_{CV}(\\Theta)는 크게 작아지지 않기 때문이다. (it`s basically fattened up)  \n만약 적은수의 feature갯수를 가지고 모델을 만들고 예측할 예정이라면 굳이 많은 양의 training data를 수집할 필요가 없다는 뜻이다. 어차피 오차율이 높기 때문에 모델이 정밀하게 예측하기 힘들기 때문에 .   \n\nHigh variance (overfit)  \n\nTraining example에서 많은 수의 feature가 있을때(높은 degree의 polinormial 피쳐등) m의 크기가 커질수록 데이터를 정확히 나타내기는 힘들지만 그래도 크게 틀리지는 않는다. (적어도 training data내에서는) 그래서 J_{train}(\\Theta)는 크게 가파르지 않게 증가한다.  \n반면, J_{CV}(\\Theta)는 high bias와 마찬가지로 m이 커질수록 낮아진다. overfit인데 m이 커질수록 error값이 더 커지지 않는 이유는 cross validate set 크기도 어느정도 크기 때문에 training set과 크게 차이가 없을 것이기 때문이다.   \n따러서, m이 작다면 이 둘이 수렴하는 값(gap)의 차이가 큰편이고 m이 커질수록 둘의 차이가 줄어든다.  따라서 High variance인 경우, 다시말해 feature가 많아서 overfitting의 위험이 있는 모델인 경우, training example을 더 많이 모을 수록 저 정확히 예측할수 있다.  \n질문: feature 를 늘릴때, polinormial feature밖에 추가를 못하는지? 가령 로그함수나, 제곱근함수 등은 사용할 필요가 없나? -> 수치해석에 따르면 모든 미분가능한 함수는 다항식의 합으로 근사할 수 있다(Taylor Series)    \n6.6. Deciding What to Do Next Revisited\n\n지금까지를 정리하면 다음과 같다.   \n  \n그리고 마지막으로 NN에 대해서도 알아보자.   \n  \n적은수의 parameter와 layer수는 underfitting 이고 많은 수는 그반대.  \nhidden unit layer갯수에 따라 어떻게 달라질까?  \nModel Complexity Effects:  \n\nLower-order polynomials (low model complexity) have high bias and low variance. In this case, the model fits poorly consistently.  \nHigher-order polynomials (high model complexity) fit the training data extremely well and the test data extremely poorly. These have low bias on the training data, but very high variance.  \n\nIn reality, we would want to choose a model somewhere in between, that can generalize well but also fits the data reasonably well.  \n\n\n"},"documents/ex5.html":{"url":"documents/ex5.html","title":"ex5","keywords":"","body":"\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n    tex2jax: {\n        inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ]\n    }\n    });\n\n \n\n\n MathJax.Hub.Queue([\"Typeset\",MathJax.Hub]); \n\n\n\nex5\n\nPart 2: Regularized Linear Regression Cost\nfunction [J, grad] = linearRegCostFunction(X, y, theta, lambda)  \n\nH = X * theta;         % X(12x2), theta(2x1)  \nReg = (lambda / (2*m)) * sum(theta(2:end, 1) .^ 2);    % theta(2:end, 1) -> theta(1) 은 더하면 안됨.  \n\nJ = (1/(2*m)) * sum((H - y).^2) + Reg;  \n\nend\n\nPart 3: Regularized Linear Regression Gradient\nGradient 계산 하기   \nfunction [J, grad] = linearRegCostFunction(X, y, theta, lambda)  \n\nH = X * theta;                 % X(12x2), theta(2x1)  \ntheta_0 = [0; theta(2:end, :)];        % H계산 이후에 theta는 2부터 필요함.  \n\nReg = (lambda / (2*m)) * (theta_0' * theta_0);         % theta(2:end, 1) -> theta(1) 은 더하면 안됨.  \n                                                % sum(theta_0 .^ 2) 을 theta_0' * theta_0 으로 표현할 수 있음!  \nJ = (1/(2*m)) * sum((H - y).^2) + Reg;  \n\ngrad    = (1/m) * (X' * (H - y)) + ((lambda / m) * theta_0);  \n\nend\n\nPart 4: Train Linear Regression\nCaller   \n[theta] = trainLinearReg([ones(m, 1) X], y, lambda);\n\nfunction [theta] = trainLinearReg(X, y, lambda)   \n\n\n% Initialize Theta   \ninitial_theta = zeros(size(X, 2), 1);    \n\n% Create \"short hand\" for the cost function to be minimized   \ncostFunction = @(t) linearRegCostFunction(X, y, t, lambda);   \n\n% Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument   \noptions = optimset('MaxIter', 200, 'GradObj', 'on');   \n\n% Minimize using fmincg  \ntheta = fmincg(costFunction, initial_theta, options);\n\nPart 5: Learning Curve for Linear Regression\nLearning algorithm을 디버깅(검증) 하기 위해서 Learning Curve 를 그린다.
